# Game Design

{% hint style="info" %}
Everyone has a great concept in mind ... usually many ... but that doesn't mean anything.

## Define the Project

A strong foundation starts by answering five essential questions:

### **What – Elevator Pitch**

Your "What" should be a clear, uniquely definable idea that you can communicate in a few minutes. It doesn’t need exhaustive detail, but it should capture the essence of your project in a way that others can quickly understand.

### **Who – Target Audience**

Who are you building this for? Many indie developers naturally create games for people like themselves, but broadening your perspective ensures you're addressing real, obtainable needs and expectations.

### **How – Method & Approach**

Even if your idea is inspired by existing works, your execution is unique. Consider the tools, workflows, and methodologies you’ll use to bring your vision to life.

### **When – Timeframe & Scope**

Is this a short, focused project or a long-term commitment? Are there external deadlines, or is your timeline flexible? Your timeframe influences every other design decision, so define it carefully.

### **Why – Purpose & Timing**

Why this project, and why now? Your initial intuition is valid, but understanding your deeper motivations will be crucial when evaluating opportunity costs and long-term viability.

## Documentation – Write It Down

Before opening your editor, take time to document your idea. Proper documentation is critical—its absence is one of the biggest reasons many game projects never reach release.

#### **Why Document?**

* **Clarify Your Vision** – Writing forces you to refine and solidify your ideas.
* **Plan Effectively** – A design document acts as a roadmap, guiding development.
* **Invite Feedback** – Even early-stage feedback can help validate your idea.
* **Save Time** – Fully designing your game “on paper” prevents wasted effort on unnecessary coding, asset purchases, or scope creep.

Even solo developers benefit from thorough documentation—it turns abstract ideas into actionable plans.

Before you fire up your editor, take the time to craft a pitch and design document, or even a blog post or article about your concept. Proper documentation is critical—its absence is one of the primary reasons many game projects never reach release.

**Why Document?**

* **Clarify Your Vision:** Writing down your ideas forces you to think through every aspect of your game design, from concept to mechanics.
* **Plan Effectively:** A well-crafted document serves as a roadmap, helping you organize your thoughts before investing time in development.
* **Invite Feedback:** Sharing your document—even with just a few trusted peers—ensures that your idea resonates and is clearly communicated.
* **Save Time:** By fully designing your game "on paper" first, you avoid costly mistakes, wasted time in the editor, and unnecessary asset purchases.

Even if you’re working solo, commit to thorough documentation. It’s an essential step toward turning your idea into a successful project.

## Market Research – Know Your Audience

Market research isn’t just for marketing teams; it’s an essential part of game design that informs development decisions from concept to launch.

#### **Why It Matters**

* **Informed Design Decisions** – Understanding your audience ensures your game meets real player expectations.
* **Early Validation** – Professional research prevents wasted effort by identifying potential risks before development begins.
* **Competitive Edge** – Knowing the market landscape helps position your game effectively in an overcrowded space.

#### **Partner or Grassroots?**

You can start with grassroots methods—engaging in communities, forums, and informal surveys—to get an initial feel for player interest. However, professional market research services provide deeper insights that allow for more effective decision-making. A combination of both approaches often works best.

Investing time in market research ensures you’re building something people want, making it a fundamental step in professional game design.
