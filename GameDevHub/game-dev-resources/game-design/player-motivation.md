# Player Motivation

## **Introduction**

Understanding player motivation is crucial when designing a game, as it shapes how players engage with the experience and influences retention, satisfaction, and monetization. This article aims to guide game designers in identifying and utilizing motivation techniques that lead to sustainable, enjoyable experiences. Player motivations can be broadly categorized into intrinsic and extrinsic motivators, and understanding their impacts allows designers to make informed choices in game design and monetization strategies.

Motivating players is a complex topic, with much of the research available spanning psychology, behavioral economics, and social engineering. Therefore, it’s important to avoid oversimplification. The research links below offer valuable insights:

## **Intrinsic Motivation**

**Generally Thought of as Positive**

Intrinsic motivation refers to actions players take because they derive satisfaction or joy from the activity itself, rather than any external reward. It can be summed up as "playing because they enjoy it." Examples include:

* A player who enjoys organizing chaos, thus they enjoy gameplay elements that involve sorting, categorizing, or managing disorder.
* A player who enjoys solving complex puzzles or challenges purely for the intellectual satisfaction.

For designers, it’s key to understand that intrinsic motivation works best when the game is tailored to a specific audience. The more you design for a broad, general audience, the harder it becomes to sustain intrinsic motivation across all player types. A focused design, like organizing a chaotic world for players who find pleasure in this, creates a deeper connection with the player and helps build long-term engagement.

**Key Takeaways for Design:**

* Select a specific audience for your game and design gameplay mechanics around their intrinsic motivations.
* Design should focus on creating joy and satisfaction from within the gameplay itself, rather than relying heavily on external rewards.

## **Extrinsic Motivation**

**Generally Thought of as Negative**

Extrinsic motivation involves external factors that drive players to act, such as rewards or penalties. It could be framed as "carrot or stick" approaches:

* Task lists
* Fear of missing out (FOMO)
* Peer pressure
* Achievements and leaderboards

Extrinsic motivators are more broadly applicable than intrinsic ones and can be effective at getting players to take action (e.g., log in daily or complete specific tasks). However, while extrinsic motivators are effective in increasing engagement, they often lead to negative outcomes in terms of player satisfaction. Players may engage because of a reward, but this doesn’t necessarily foster a deeper emotional connection to the game.

**When is it useful?**\
Extrinsic motivators can be useful for pushing players to explore new gameplay aspects, such as trying counterintuitive playstyles or engaging with new mechanics. However, over-reliance on extrinsic motivators can result in players engaging less for intrinsic enjoyment and more because they "have to" for external rewards.

**Key Takeaways for Design:**

* Use extrinsic motivators sparingly and with a clear purpose.
* Track player behavior to ensure that the use of extrinsic motivation does not negatively impact long-term satisfaction.

## **Positive vs. Negative Extrinsic Motivation**

**The Carrot vs. The Stick**

Within extrinsic motivation, there are two broad categories: positive (rewards) and negative (punishments). Both approaches carry their own sets of risks and rewards, and balancing them is critical.

**Positive Extrinsic Motivation (Carrot/Reward)**

**Risk:** The major risk with positive rewards is that they can devalue future rewards, making the player expect constant rewards to feel motivated. Overuse can lead to addiction-like behavior, where players are only motivated by the next reward, not by the intrinsic enjoyment of the game. This dynamic can lead to frustration when rewards are not forthcoming.

**Examples of Positive Extrinsic Motivation:**

* In-game achievements
* Daily login rewards
* Item or cosmetic rewards for completing tasks

**Key Takeaways for Design:**

* Avoid overuse of rewards; ensure rewards do not overshadow intrinsic enjoyment.
* Gradually scale down rewards to maintain challenge and excitement.

**Negative Extrinsic Motivation (Stick/Punishment)**

**Risk:** Negative motivation tends to be more manageable compared to positive rewards in terms of player satisfaction. Negative motivators—such as competition, leaderboards, and penalties—can foster short-term engagement and drive performance. However, they also tend to create frustration, toxic behavior, or burnout, especially if misused.

**Examples of Negative Extrinsic Motivation:**

* Competitive leaderboards
* Time-limited challenges with penalties for failure
* Fear of losing progress or assets

**Key Takeaways for Design:**

* Negative motivators can be effective when used to create challenge and tension, but they should not be the sole driver of gameplay.
* Be mindful of their impact on player psychology; avoid creating toxic communities.

## **Risks and Balance in Using Motivation**

**Positive Risks:**

* Overreliance on rewards (e.g., loot boxes, achievements) may undermine long-term satisfaction.
* The "addiction effect" can occur when players are conditioned to expect constant rewards.
* A sense of entitlement may develop, and players might disengage or become upset when rewards do not meet expectations.

**Negative Risks:**

* Negative motivators can cause toxic behavior (e.g., harassment on leaderboards) or burnout from constant competition.
* Too much punitive motivation can alienate players, leading to high churn rates or negative reviews.
* If overused, negative motivators can lead to resentment or frustration, especially if they feel unfair or overly demanding.

**Balance and Design Considerations:**\
The key to effective game design is balance. Mixing intrinsic and extrinsic motivations allows designers to create gameplay loops that are both engaging and sustainable. Too much emphasis on extrinsic rewards (positive or negative) may generate short-term engagement but won’t foster a meaningful connection to the game.

## **Conclusion**

Understanding player motivation is not a simple task, and it requires a nuanced approach. Intrinsic motivations often lead to long-term, satisfying engagement, while extrinsic motivations can provide short-term spikes in activity but may lead to dissatisfaction if overused.

As a game designer, the goal should be to align your game’s progression and mechanics with intrinsic motivations for your core audience, while using extrinsic motivators sparingly and with care. Tracking player behavior and regularly refining your design will ensure that your game continues to resonate with players, keeping them motivated to play and engage over time.
