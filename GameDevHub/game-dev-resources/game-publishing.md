# Game Publishing

Publishing is a critical decision point for any game developer. Whether you’re a solo developer, a small studio, or an indie team, understanding the options—and their trade-offs—can help you plan a successful launch. This guide covers the three primary publishing models:

* **Self-Publishing**
* **Indie Publishing**
* **Traditional Publishing**

Each model carries its own benefits and challenges, and the right choice will depend on your project’s scale, your team’s capabilities, and your financial situation.

## Self-Publishing

#### What It Means

Self-publishing means you are wholly responsible for every aspect of the game’s lifecycle. Although it’s termed “self,” this approach isn’t about doing everything on your own; rather, it means you’re funding the entire project and then managing the services you need:

* **Managed Services:**
  * **Marketing:** Sourcing and partnering with marketing professionals or agencies.
  * **Localization:** Arranging translation and cultural adaptation if your game targets international markets.
  * **Ratings & Compliance:** Engaging with agencies such as PEGI, ESRB, etc., to ensure your game meets platform requirements.

You’re in control of every partnership, negotiating contracts directly, and paying upfront for these services. While this offers complete creative and financial control, it also means you bear all the risks.

#### Revenue Realities

Data on Steam shows that:

* **Approximately 90% of games** on Steam earn **less than $5,000** over their lifetime.
* Of the games that pass the $5,000 threshold, only a small fraction (roughly **2-3%**) manage to break into the $100,000+ territory.

This means that—without a strong investment in marketing and professional support—a self-published game might not even be solvent. Reaching “beyond hobby” success typically requires substantial upfront investment and business savvy.

## Indie Publishing

#### What It Is

Indie publishing offers a middle ground. While indie publishers typically don’t cover the full development costs, they can help you with:

* **Launch Support:** Expertise in preparing your game for release.
* **Marketing:** Running campaigns that boost visibility.
* **Localization & Additional Services:** Ensuring your game is ready for international markets.

In return, indie publishers take a smaller cut of your revenue than traditional publishers, and you maintain more creative control. However, deals may include revenue-sharing and sometimes stipulations like exclusivity. **Exclusivity, in particular, can be risky**—it may lock you into a deal that limits your earnings potential over the game’s lifetime.

#### Notable Programs & Publishers

Several companies and programs aim to support indie developers:

* **Epic Games:** Their MegaGrants program offers financial support to indie developers and can be a valuable resource.
* **Devolver Digital, Annapurna Interactive, tinyBuild, and Raw Fury:** These indie publishers are known for helping developers with marketing, localization, and launch services.
* **Platform-specific programs:** Many digital storefronts and regional publishers offer tailored support packages for indie projects.

Be cautious when negotiating—ensure that any revenue share or exclusivity terms will still leave you with a viable profit margin.

## Traditional Publishing

#### The Traditional Route

Traditional publishers offer full development funding and robust marketing and distribution networks. However, they come with significant trade-offs:

* **High Risk for Developers:** The capital provided may come with strings attached—rigid control over your project and revenue splits that might favor the publisher.
* **Predatory Tendencies:** There are numerous accounts of traditional publishing deals that have effectively “killed” small studios or even affected larger ones.
* **Loss of Creative Control:** Traditional publishers often insist on tight oversight and may make decisions that conflict with your creative vision.

For many indie developers, traditional publishing is not recommended unless you have a track record and can negotiate terms that protect your interests.

## Making the Right Choice

#### Consider Your Goals and Resources

* **Self-Publishing:** Best if you’re willing to invest heavily in marketing and external services, and you have the business skills to manage all aspects of the release.
* **Indie Publishing:** Offers a balance between control and support. This option can be ideal if you need help launching your game but don’t want to give up creative freedom.
* **Traditional Publishing:** While it can provide significant resources, the loss of control and potentially unfavorable financial terms make it a risky choice for most indie developers.

#### Realities of the Market

The data is clear: most indie games on Steam struggle to generate significant revenue. If you’re aiming for more than hobby-level success, you must either secure funding for professional support or partner with an indie publisher that can deliver the necessary marketing, localization, and launch services.

## Conclusion

Every publishing model has its trade-offs. Self-publishing offers total control but comes with substantial risk and requires significant investment in “managed services.” Indie publishing can provide valuable support without as heavy a revenue cut, though be very cautious with exclusivity clauses. Traditional publishing, with its full funding and marketing power, often comes at the cost of creative and financial autonomy.

Carefully evaluate your project’s needs, your financial capacity, and your long-term goals before choosing a publishing path. Doing so will ensure you’re set up for success—or at least not trapped by a deal that limits your game’s potential.
