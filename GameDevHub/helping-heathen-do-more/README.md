# Helping Heathen Do More!

Becoming a [sponsor of Heathen on GitHub or Patreon](https://github.com/sponsors/heathen-engineering) is the best way to support us and enable us to deliver more articles, videos, tools, examples, support, and just more! It's also the best way to buy/license all of Heathen's Toolkits, assets and services.

Heathen keeps 100% of the fee (less payment processing) from the Sponsor option. You get access to all of our tools, a site-based license and instant updates. The stores are maintained for those that prefer them but they do take 30% of the fee and require significantly more administration on our part and thus they are simply not as efficient of a place to license Heathen Tools.
