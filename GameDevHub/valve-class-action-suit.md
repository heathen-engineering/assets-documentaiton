# Valve Class Action Suit

Some of you may have received a letter or email about a **class action lawsuit against Valve**. It looks official and can seem intimidating — especially if English isn't your first language.

#### ❓ What's This All About?

This is a **U.S. class action lawsuit** claiming Valve's pricing policies are anti-competitive. The court has not decided anything yet, and **Valve has not been found guilty**.

The notice was sent to many developers who sell games on Steam — it doesn’t mean you're in trouble. It just means you might be affected if the case goes forward.

### 💡 Our Recommendation: Consider Opting Out

In our opinion, this lawsuit is **frivolous** and unlikely to benefit small or indie developers. By staying in the class:

* You **give up the right to sue Valve yourself** over this issue later.
* You become part of a legal case that **doesn't reflect most developers’ views** of the platform.

If you **opt out**, you:

* Keep your legal rights.
* Don’t participate in any judgment or payout.
* Avoid being associated with what may be a poor legal precedent.
