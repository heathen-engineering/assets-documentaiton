# Welcome

Modern games are pushing boundaries with worlds that feel alive, from dynamic economies and social systems to emergent AI behaviours and complex environmental simulations. Building these systems is difficult. Proprietary solutions like Nemesis or Radiant AI demonstrate what is possible, but they are often tied to a single game, engine, or company. Developers who want to create their own living, emergent worlds usually have to reinvent the wheel every time.

**Our goal is to fill this gap.**

The **Toolkit for Data** is a flexible, general-purpose toolkit designed to empower game developers of all types, from engineers and designers to artists, hobbyists, and professionals. Following the layered Heathen Toolkit approach, it provides:

* **Engine-agnostic foundations** for cross-platform development.
* **Modular building blocks** to create living worlds, including AI behaviours, factions, economy systems, and environmental simulations.
* **Emergent system tools** that allow you to build behaviours similar to Nemesis or Radiant AI, without being locked into a proprietary solution.

The toolkit is still in early development. Informal experiments are available to our GitHub Sponsors through the **Source Repo**, where it is listed as the **Narrative Plugin for Unreal**. This gives early access to building blocks and concepts, emphasising experimentation, learning, and community feedback.

Whether you are working on an indie RPG, a large-scale MMO, or exploring emergent systems for the first time, the Toolkit for Data provides a foundation and flexible tools to bring your world to life.

## Dog Food

The Toolkit for Data is not just a research exercise; it is a **strategic investment in our own games**. We are developing this technology to power the emergent, living-world simulations at the heart of our projects. As soon as the work solidifies, we plan to expose it as a tool for other developers to use.

This space will serve as a **public window into our R\&D process**. Throughout each phase, we will document experiments, design decisions, successes, and challenges, giving the community insight into how complex simulation systems are built from the ground up.

Once features materialise, this Knowledge Base will transform into **living documentation** for the toolkit, serving engineers, designers, and creators who want to leverage these systems in their own projects.

If certain experiments fail, we will treat this as a **post-mortem resource**, capturing lessons learned and providing a reference for future efforts. Every step, whether success or failure, contributes to building more robust, reusable tools and sharing valuable knowledge with the wider game development community.
