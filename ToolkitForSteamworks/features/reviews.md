# Reviews

Steam reviews are a powerful force in shaping the success of your game. They influence visibility, affect conversion rates, and reflect your relationship with your community. Like it or not, reviews are among the most important factors in whether a game succeeds or quietly disappears.

This guide covers the essentials of how reviews work, what to expect, and how to handle them responsibly.

#### Why Reviews Matter

Steam’s recommendation systems heavily factor in your game’s review score and activity. A high rating can significantly boost visibility, leading to more traffic, higher conversion rates, and ultimately more sales.

Conversely, negative reviews—especially early ones—can sharply reduce your reach. One poor experience, even if rare or isolated, can outweigh dozens of positive ones in a potential buyer’s mind.

> 🧠 **Rule of Thumb:** _One screw-up is worth a thousand accolades._\
> That’s not just true of Steam—it’s human psychology. People remember bad experiences more vividly than good ones.

#### Your First 10 Reviews

Steam won’t display a public rating for your game until you have at least **10 user reviews**. These first reviews are critical—they set the tone for your game’s public perception and affect your visibility during the high-traffic launch window.

To improve your chances:

* Cultivate a **supportive community** ahead of launch.
* Engage with players in Discord, forums, or newsletters.
* Make it easy and natural for your early players to leave a review.
* Avoid begging—genuine engagement leads to better outcomes.

> 🚀 Better visibility = more organic traffic and sales

#### Responding to Reviews

In most cases, **do not respond** to reviews. Steam reviews are a customer’s space to share their experience, not a discussion thread with the developer.

If you must reply (e.g., to answer a question or direct users to support), keep it professional, factual, and brief. Never argue or try to justify a negative experience—it will only reflect poorly on you.

> ⚠️ **Never respond emotionally.** Even a well-intentioned reply can be misinterpreted.

#### What **Not** to Do

**🚫 Buy Reviews**

Never pay for reviews. Ever. Valve strictly prohibits this and has banned games and publishers for violations. Don’t engage third-party services that promise reviews, and don’t incentivise players in exchange for positive feedback.

**🚫 Post Self-Reviews**

Don’t review your own game using alternate accounts. Valve detects this easily, and if caught, your game can be delisted. Also, avoid asking your friends or teammates to leave reviews unless they are genuine customers with no direct connection to development.

**🚫 Harass Reviewers**

No matter how unfair a review may seem, **do not retaliate or attack the reviewer**. Even if they refund the game after finishing it, or leave a sarcastic comment, resist the urge to react. Hostile developer behavior can go viral fast and do lasting damage to your studio’s reputation.

#### The Role of Community Management

Community engagement is your best defense and strongest tool. Positive communities lead to positive reviews. Keep players informed, acknowledge their feedback, and be active in your community spaces.

#### Final Thoughts

Reviews are more than just ratings—they’re public, persistent reflections of your relationship with your audience. Approach them with care, humility, and professionalism. A small studio has the advantage of authenticity—use it well.
