# Launch

This article is a collection of considerations and tips for launching your game. In this context, "launch" does not just mean release. It means you have made your product public, whether through a store page, a blog, a product for sale, a Kickstarter campaign, or any other means. If people can publicly talk about your product, it is considered "launched." With that in mind, there are several key factors to plan for.

### Discovery and Visibility

#### Wishlists and Ranking

* **Aim for a Baseline:**\
  Have at least 7,000 wishlists by the time your game is one week out from launch. Although the absolute number isn't everything, wishlists directly affect your ranking for upcoming games on Steam.
* **Why It Matters:**\
  Steam ranks upcoming games by wishlist count. A higher rank increases your chances of being featured on the Popular Upcoming list, which can drive additional wishlists and boost overall visibility.
* **Publisher Targets:**\
  Your publisher might aim for tens of thousands of wishlists based on your target market and conversion rates. The 7,000 figure is a starting point; successful marketing efforts should drive your numbers much higher.

#### Action Steps

* **Festivals:**\
  Submit your game to every festival for which it qualifies. Avoid festivals that don’t match your game’s genre or style, as this can have an adverse impact.
* **Steam Next Fest:**\
  Choose a Next Fest that ends more than a week before your launch, but as close to your launch week as possible. Ensure your game has a playable demo, as this is required to participate and can help you achieve the necessary wishlists.

#### When to Launch Your Store Page

* **Timing:**\
  Publish your store page as soon as you have finalised what your game is. This allows you to start building wishlists immediately.
* **Key Components:**
  * Capsule images
  * Screenshots
  * A teaser (not a full trailer)
  * Short and full descriptions
  * Content rating
  * System requirements
  * Feature list

#### Why It Matters

A complete and polished store page is critical because:

* It is the first point of contact for potential wishlisters.
* Major changes to the store page after launch can confuse or deter users.
* A strong store page lays the foundation for all subsequent marketing efforts.

### Coming Soon

#### Setting a Release Date

* **Importance:**\
  Once your store page is live, set a specific release date. A defined release date helps Steam categorise your game as "upcoming," which is essential for appearing on the Popular Upcoming list.
* **Tip:**\
  Ensure your release date remains fixed for a sufficient period (around one week before launch) to accumulate wishlists and build momentum.

### Demo

#### Build Early Interest

* **Why You Need a Demo:**\
  A demo is often required to participate in Steam Next Fest and many festivals. Even if your game is free-to-play, a pre-release demo is an effective way to generate interest and drive wishlists.
* **Quality Matters:**\
  Your demo should represent the best aspects of your game to capture the attention of potential players. While it's tempting to just make your "demo" a subset of your game, consider a separate demo project, a custom-built "vertical slice" that shows off your game's best systems, from character creator to major end-game bosses, which isn't achievable if you're just taking the start or a specific level and making it the demo.

### [Early Access](features/early-access.md)

#### Proceed with Caution

* **Considerations:**\
  Early Access is a double-edged sword. While it can build momentum if executed well, it requires significant staffing and management that most indie developers may not have.
* **Recommendation:**\
  Unless you are a professional small studio with a proven track record of managing Early Access successfully, consider alternative methods such as demos or [Playtests](features/playtest.md).

### [Playtest](features/playtest.md), Alpha, and Beta

#### Testing and Community Engagement

* [**Playtest**](features/playtest.md)**:**\
  Useful for gathering early feedback and building community engagement, especially if your game has a unique "hook." However, a demo is often a more effective marketing tool for many games.
* [**Alpha / Beta**](features/branches.md)**:**\
  While these stages are great for technical testing, they are less ideal for marketing purposes. For public testing as a marketing tool, focus on Playtests and demos; for controlled testing, use Alpha/Beta branches.

***

### Summary and Key Takeaways

* **Visibility is Critical:**\
  Achieve a solid number of wishlists before launch to secure a high ranking on Steam’s Popular Upcoming list.
* **Plan Your Store Page Carefully:**\
  Launch a complete and polished store page early, as it is the cornerstone of your marketing efforts.
* **Set a Fixed Release Date:**\
  Ensure your game is marked as "upcoming" long enough to build sufficient momentum.
* **Choose the Right Pre-Launch Strategy:**\
  Use demos, Playtests, or controlled Alpha/Beta testing depending on your game’s needs and your team's capabilities.
* **Early Access Is Not for Everyone:**\
  Consider the challenges and resources required before opting for an Early Access approach.
