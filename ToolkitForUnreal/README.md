**Prefer Traditional Stores?**

Get one year of updates and professional support for just the tools you want via the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/5836) or [FAB](https://www.fab.com/sellers/Heathen%20Engineering).

{% hint style="info" %}
_Purchases through the Unity Asset Store or FAB follow their standard licensing terms, which, at the time of writing, are per-user. The version you buy is yours permanently. Each year, a new major release will be available as an update and support package, offered to existing users at 20% of the base price. You may continue using any previous version indefinitely. Older versions are not revoked or disabled._
