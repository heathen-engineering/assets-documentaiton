## Introduction

Heathen's Breakable collection is a set of assets that are … well … breakable. That is you can smash, splinter and fracture these assets.

Our Breakable assets include "whole" and "broken" versions hand crafted for a clean and professional look. Included are scripts to help drive the break either through physics interactions or by command along with events making it trivial to sync over network or through other systems in your game.
