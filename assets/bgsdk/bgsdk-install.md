# Installation

## Package Manager

The preferred method of installation is via the Unity Package Manager. This method assumes you are comfortable with installing open source Unity assets from Git via the Package Manager Git integration.

1. Open the package manager and click the '+' (plus) button located in the upper left of the window
2. Select `Add package from git URL...` when prompted provide the following URL:\
   `https://github.com/heathen-engineering/BGSDK-Foundation.git?path=/Package`

## Unity Package Import

This alternative is useful if you have issues with Unity Package Manager or would like to modify the code of the asset within your Unity project.

1. Download the latest `unitypackage` from the GitHub releases page:\
   [https://github.com/heathen-engineering/BGSDK-Foundation/releases](https://github.com/heathen-engineering/BGSDK-Foundation/releases)
2. Import the `unitypackage` into your project
