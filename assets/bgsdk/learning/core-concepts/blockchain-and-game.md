TL; DR\
\
Stop trying to apply "real value" to your game worlds.

Driving user engagement based on the prospect of profit is gambling and makes it impossible to be a real "game" in the since we use the term in the game industry … you become a "game" in the since used in the gambling/gaming industry.

We as a company are not against gambling, but this article is about Blockchain & Game not Blockchain & Gambling.

## Introduction

A rather huge problem with the Blockchain hype and the craze around NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) is that it hasn't been made particularly clear how these are used in game or really anywhere. This is further aggravated by an influx of people and companies taking advantage of the situation and the hype to cause real harm. We hope this article will help clarify the concepts of NFT and Game and in particular Heathen's stance on the topic.

While others may have different opinions from a game developer's point of view its best to think of an NFT as a license. If your old enough to remember when games came in a box you may remember "CD Keys" these where unique identifiers that represented your license to play the game and had to be entered to install the game on your machine. A NFT is best used as a "CD Key" of sorts, that is as a means to know who has the licensing rights to consume a given bit of content.

Blockchain in and of its self is really nothing more than a ledger or transactional database in that it holds some data about the transactions performed against it. Unlike a traditional ledger or database a blockchain is distributed or "decentralized" … a lovely little buzz word that simply means the ledge isn't held on 1 server but is community wide content and can thus be verified and validated by any member of the community.

### Ownership

Ownership is a concept that has become confused as of late and I really don't understand why its confusing.

When you buy a movie, picture, song, book, game or any other such thing you are not buying the rights to the property you are buying a consumer license to a copy of the property. You cannot duplicate it and in some cases you cannot transfer the license depending on the terms the license may also be revocable or restrict your use in other ways.&#x20;

Why all of a sudden there is confusion about the concept of "license" I am not sure. This is not a new concept and has always been the case well before games where even a thing never mind digital games or blockchain technology.

With regards to NFTs it is our opinion that you should make it clear that this is no different than buying a skin in Fortnight, a game on Steam, a Mount in World of Warcraft, etc. Digital goods exchanged for real money even between players out side of the game world is nothing new to the game industry. Blockchain doesn't add any new concepts to "Ownership" at all.

### Content

While it is possible to embed your content in the NFT its self there is no useful reason to do so. Considering your NFT represents a license to some media and like any media that media may need to be updated, adapted, etc. over time its our opinion that its best to not store any such data in the NFT its self rather use it as a simple "key" to denote access to some content in your game world or a license to play the game or DLC, etc.

Rather you host your content on a content delivery system, ship it on a disk, upload it as a torrent, etc. none of that matters. The blockchain simply tracks transactions and the current holder of a given NFT is simply the person you may or may not identify as having a license to some content. An NFT for that matter isn't even a recipe of transaction it really is nothing more than a "CD Key" as noted above.

## Why

So if you read the above at all you may be wondering …

If an NFT is no different than Steam Inventory, DLC, MTX items such as Fortnight skins, WoW mounts, etc.&#x20;

and

If NFTs are basically comparable to Inventory items or at best DLC licenses why bother with NFT at all?

In most of the cases we hear pitched around; you shouldn't be considering NFT for that. Minting and transferring NFTs has a cost and complexity that is very often higher than other more traditional solutions for most in-game use cases you may be thinking of.

### Ownership of Stuff

As noted above this is an abuse of the term "ownership" and in reality this is no different than say Steam Inventory so isn't a blockchain/NFT only concept. Sitting that aside you certainly can use blockchain technology to yield a system very similar to Steam's Inventory and that can be used to devise interesting mechanics and systems for your game in particular around the social aspect of the game.

The major issue with using NFTs for this is the cost. While blockchain operations do have a cost there is always a cost to operations even if you did this with a standard database server. Operating a database or anything really has a cost so the fact that a blockchain has a monetary cost to operate shouldn't invalidate it from consideration. Most chains have a high cost and are very slow so most chains actually are not terribly useful for this however some like MATIC are very low cost and fairly fast.

Using blockchain based technologies to manage your inventory like system is an option, however its probably not the best approach for most use cases. Platforms like Steam offer vastly superior features to anything any current blockchain can do and they do it at no cost to you. Tools like PlayFab and GameLift offer the same for a cost but are platform independent. The only notable factor of blockchain compared to other options is that it is not specific to a platform or service (theoretically) so concepts like Enjin do have some merit for some very specific use cases.

Big Red Flag Though\

{% endhint %}

The big red flag to this rather or not your using blockchain … that is this problem applies to Steam Inventory and any other inventory system in any game or platform. The issue is that when you attach "real" value to in-game concepts you move your game into the realm of gambling and securities depending on implementation. The fun of your game is no longer based on story, systems or mechanics but on profit and efficiency and your very likely to run afoul of gambling, securities or similar regulatory issues.

### Play To Earn

First this concept in and of its self would be highly destructive for most projects adding real monetary value to a game system changes the very nature of that system and how it impacts the user moving away from "fun" and toward "profit". Adding monetary value to activities in your product also makes your project a gambling product as opposed to a game. That is by making the reward of your "game" profit, you have become a gambling product if not always in the legal since then defiantly in the spirit of gambling.

That said gambling is a legitimate industry and if your creating a gambling product then yes this could be an interesting and novel mechanic and the distributed nature of blockchain could allow for a very wide reach. Gambling however is not Heathen's area of interest or expertise and deals with a lot of strict regulation. In Heathen's opinion Pay To Earn either would or should be classified as gambling and thus falls out of scope for our interests and this article.
