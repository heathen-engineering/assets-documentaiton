## Introduction

A rather huge problem with the Blockchain hype and the craze around NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) is that it hasn't been made particularly clear how these are used in game or really anywhere.

While others may have different openions from a game developer's point of view its best to think of an NFT as a license. If your old enough to remimber when games came in a box you may remimber "CD Keys" these where unique identifiers that represented your license to play the game and had to be entered to install the game on your machine. A NFT is best used as a "CD Key" that is as a means to know who has the licensing rights to consume a given bit of content.

### Ownership

Ownership is a concept that has become confused as of late and I really dont understand why its confusing.

When you buy a movie, picture, song, book, game or any other such thing you are not buying the rights to the propery you are buying a consumer license to a copy of the property. You cannot duplicate it and in some cases you cannot transfer the license depending on the terms the license may also be revokable or restrict your use in other ways.&#x20;

Why all of a sudden there is confusion about the concept of "license" I am not sure.

With regards to NFTs it is our openion that you should make it clear that this is no different than buying a skin in Fortnight, a game on Steam, a Mount in World of Warcraft, etc. Digital goods exchanged for real money even between players out side of the game world is nothing new to the game industry.&#x20;

### Content

While it is possible to embed your content in the NFT its self there is no useful reason to do so. Considering your NFT represents a license to some media and like any media that media may need to be updated, adapted, etc. over time its our openion that its best to not store any such data in the NFT its self rather use it as a simple "key" to denote access to some content in your game world.

## Why

So if you read the above at all you may be wondering ....

If NFT is no different than Steam Inventory, MTX items such as Fortnight skins, WoW mounts, etc.&#x20;

If NFTs are basicly comparable to Inventroy items or at best DLC licenses why bother with NFT at all?

In most of the cases we hear pitched you shouldn't be considering NFT for that. There are however strong use cases where Blockchain technology brings features and capabilities that aren't posssible or perhaps are but are not practicle with it.
