TL; DR\
\
Stop trying to apply "real value" to your game worlds.

\
Driving user engagement based on the prospect of profit is gambling and makes it impossible to be a real "game" in the since we use the term in the game industry … you become a "game" in the since used in the gambling/gaming industry.

&#x20;

We as a company are not against gambling, but this article is about Blockchain & Game not Blockchain & Gambling. Yes of course a video game can be mixed with elements of gambling e.g. skin trading, world first betting, leaderboard betting, professional gaming, etc. Again that is outside the scope of this document.

## Introduction

A rather huge problem with the Blockchain hype and the craze around NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) is that it hasn't been made particularly clear how these are used in game or really anywhere. This is further aggravated by an influx of people and companies taking advantage of the situation and the hype to cause real harm. We hope this article will help clarify the concepts of NFT and Game and in particular Heathen's stance on the topic.

While others may have different opinions from a game developer's point of view its best to think of an NFT as a license. If your old enough to remember when games came in a box you may remember "CD Keys" these where unique identifiers that represented your license to play the game and had to be entered to install the game on your machine. A NFT is best used as a "CD Key" of sorts, that is as a means to know who has the licensing rights to consume a given bit of content.

Blockchain in and of its self is really nothing more than a ledger or transactional database in that it holds some data about the transactions performed against it. Unlike a traditional ledger or database a blockchain is distributed or "decentralized" … a lovely little buzz word that simply means the ledge isn't held on 1 server but is community wide content and can thus be verified and validated by any member of the community.

### Ownership

Ownership is a concept that has become confused as of late and I really don't understand why its confusing.

When you buy a movie, picture, song, book, game or any other such thing you are not buying the rights to the property you are buying a consumer license to a copy of the property. You cannot duplicate it and in some cases you cannot transfer the license depending on the terms the license may also be revocable or restrict your use in other ways.&#x20;

Why all of a sudden there is confusion about the concept of "license" I am not sure. This is not a new concept and has always been the case well before games where even a thing never mind digital games or blockchain technology.

With regards to NFTs it is our opinion that you should make it clear that this is no different than buying a skin in Fortnight, a game on Steam, a Mount in World of Warcraft, etc. Digital goods exchanged for real money even between players out side of the game world is nothing new to the game industry. Blockchain doesn't add any new concepts to "Ownership" at all.

### Content

While it is possible to embed your content in the NFT its self there is no useful reason to do so. Considering your NFT represents a license to some media and like any media that media may need to be updated, adapted, etc. over time its our opinion that its best to not store any such data in the NFT its self rather use it as a simple "key" to denote access to some content in your game world or a license to play the game or DLC, etc.

Rather you host your content on a content delivery system, ship it on a disk, upload it as a torrent, etc. none of that matters. The blockchain simply tracks transactions and the current holder of a given NFT is simply the person you may or may not identify as having a license to some content. An NFT for that matter isn't even a recipe of transaction it really is nothing more than a "CD Key" as noted above.

## Why

So if you read the above at all you may be wondering …

If an NFT is no different than Steam Inventory, DLC, MTX items such as Fortnight skins, WoW mounts, etc.&#x20;

and

If NFTs are basically comparable to Inventory items or at best DLC licenses why bother with NFT at all?

In most of the cases we hear pitched around; you shouldn't be considering NFT for that. Minting and transferring NFTs has a cost and complexity that is very often higher than other more traditional solutions for most in-game use cases you may be thinking of.

### Metaverse

So this is another buzz word horribly abused. Lets start by defining the actual word and we will get into what people mean when they say it.

#### Reality ( literal definition )

{% hint style="info" %}
Meta\
From Greek, meaning 'with, across or after' \
Most commonly (till today) used in science to denote position or relationship e.g. metacarpus meaning behind, after or beyond the wrist ... carpus is Greek for wrist
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Verse\
From Latin Vertere meaning to turn or Versus referring to a line or furrow
{% endhint %}

So we use the word "meta" to mean things beyond the context we are talking in ... "That's so meta" being a term that should mean that topic is beyond this scope. Yes zoomers like to use meta to refer to the most efficient solution to a mechanic but its to late for them :joy: so lets move on

The word verse we use to mean a world, such as the MCU or Marvel Cinematic Universe being shortened to the Marvel verse; and this ties into its original use referring to a line, suggesting or meaning the entirety of a thing.

So if we sit aside the fact that Meta is Greek and Verse Latin and so shouldn't be mixed really … we can say that "Metaverse" should mean "all the **stuff** beyond the entirety of **stuff**" … your head hurt yet about how stupid this term is :smile:

#### Current / Pop Use

It really does depend on who your are talking to since for most groups, companies and people "metaverse" means "buzz word that makes you listen to me"&#x20;

But generally its referring to an echo-system \
( buzz word for this topic from 3 or 4 generations ago )\
That is a collection of systems, apps, content, etc. that all work together. For example Unity Asset Store, Unity Assets, Various Unity Communities, Games as Experiences built on Unity ... you could say that is a "metaverse" you probably wouldn't but its no different than what "Meta" aka Facebook are doing.\
\
Similarly most social games could be called a "metaverse" in that they are more than just the game its self but include a whole universe of interrelated stuff both within the game and under the control of the developer/publisher and outside the game and in the control of the community/public.

#### Blockchain Use

So how does blockchain fit in?

It doesn't really, well that is, its not a requirement for a "metaverse" or "echo system" or to create "synergies" or any of the other buzz words we have used over the years to mean "bunch of stuff working together" … \
\
Blockchain at best can be used as the database you use to track who has what licenses to what stuff … so again no different than inventory systems in Steam, PlayFab, GameLift, etc. One advantage blockchain could offer is that you do not require an agreement between game developers in that tokens can be transferred without the approval of developers … so for example your indie game could read a wallet that holds stuff from a Ubisoft game and do something about it. …\
And that is exactly why this will never become main stream :drum:

You will never see Mast Chief racing against Mario in a Gran Turismo ranked race your playing on your Android cell phone running iOS.

IPs have walled gardens not because they cant work together … they can and it would be easier than not ... that is companies go through great lengths spending a lot of money to wall their respective gardens off … they have walled gardens to protect there IP and give a reason for you to come to them as opposed to their competitors e.g. exclusivity; thus "metaverse" is just another buzzword that means my brand of walled garden no different than PSNow, XBox Game Pass, Play Store, etc..

### Ownership of Stuff

As noted above this is an abuse of the term "ownership" and in reality this is no different than say Steam Inventory so isn't a blockchain/NFT only concept. Sitting that aside you certainly can use blockchain technology to yield a system very similar to Steam's Inventory and that can be used to devise interesting mechanics and systems for your game in particular around the social aspect of the game.

The major issue with using NFTs for this is the cost. While blockchain operations do have a cost there is always a cost to operations even if you did this with a standard database server. Operating a database or anything really has a cost so the fact that a blockchain has a monetary cost to operate shouldn't invalidate it from consideration. Most chains have a high cost and are very slow so most chains actually are not terribly useful for this however some like MATIC are very low cost and fairly fast.

Using blockchain based technologies to manage your inventory like system is an option, however its probably not the best approach for most use cases. Platforms like Steam offer vastly superior features to anything any current blockchain can do and they do it at no cost to you. Tools like PlayFab and GameLift offer the same for a cost but are platform independent. The only notable factor of blockchain compared to other options is that it is not specific to a platform or service (theoretically) so concepts like Enjin do have some merit for some very specific use cases.

Big Red Flag Though\
read on!
{% endhint %}

The big red flag to this rather or not your using blockchain … that is this problem applies to Steam Inventory and any other inventory system in any game or platform. The issue is that when you attach "real" value to in-game concepts you move your game into the realm of gambling and securities depending on implementation. The fun of your game is no longer based on story, systems or mechanics but on profit and efficiency and your very likely to run afoul of gambling, securities or similar regulatory issues.
