# Licensing

## Introduction

You have 3 ways to license Heathen's assets and content discribed in detail in each section below. In general the best way to license Heathen's Steamworks, PhysKit and UX is to become a GitHub Sponsor.

## GitHub Sponsor

For small teams and indies this is really the best method for you and for Heathen.

With GitHub sponsor you can get access to our source repository for Steamworks, PhysKit and UX Complete at the 10 USD tier. This means instant access to all 3 for 10 quid ... that is better than any one of the assets even if its on sale and this way you get all 3.

While your subscribed you get instant live updates, a proper issue tracking system, feedback system and of course all the perks you would expect from any Heathen product e.g. best-in-class support, live community and more.

When you end your subscription you still have whatever you downloaded and yes a [license](heathen-license-agreement.md) to go with it. You can re-sub when you need to catch up on updates or get that sweet sweet priority support ... or maybe you just want to show your support for Heathen.

## Bespoke License

For larger teams, studios or situations where the standard license just wont work for you Heathen can create a custom licensing solution, support terms, contracting and or consulting to meet your needs.

In all cases Bespoke means ... well bespoke that is custom ... so to get started with this you first need to reachout to us either over [Discord](https://discord.gg/6X3xrRc), [Email ](mailto://support@heathen.group?subject=Bespoke%20Licensing)or check out our [main site](https://heathen.group) for more details.

## Unity Asset Store

The classic approch. Unity Asset Store is a solid, tried and true option, you probably already know about it, and this is how you probably learned about Heathen.

While we think of the Asset Store as less than ideal for a great many reasons we will continue to support it so long its a viable option to deliver a quality product.

Asset updates on the Unity Asset Store are nessisarily slower and have some limitations on what we can offer in terms of services, promotions, etc. The installation method is a bit ... okay ... a lot more error prone as it still uses .unitypackage even though it has you download those through the Package Manager .\
.. hopfully that will change soon (hurry up Unity)

As far as the licensing terms, refunds, etc. we really cant do anything there its all 100% Unity Technology. When it comes to the Unity Asset Store we are basicly a blind vendor, we get a cut of sales but wont even be aware you exist unless you find us to start a conversation.

We of course offer support through our community channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/6X3xrRc) and we do release updates frequently to the Store so this isn't a bad option its just a bit antiquated and limiting for you and us alike and has basicly no flexability at all.
