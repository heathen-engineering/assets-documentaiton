PhysKit is a collection of physics focused APIs, componenets and tools providing stable easy to use solutions to common physics simulation needs.

All PhysKit features are designed to be light weight, modular and work along side Unity's built in tools and features not replace them.

### Key Features

[Verlet Spring](intorduction.md)

Add dynamic physics bsed motion to transforms and armature bones
