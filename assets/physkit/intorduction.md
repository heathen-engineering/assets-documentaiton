# AniBone

## Introduction

AniBone is available as a stand alone asset on the Unity Asset Store

{% embed url="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/physkit-anibone-173686" %}

AniBone is a component of PhysKit that allows you to quickly and easily apply physics based dynamic animations to armature bones and transforms. A single script added to a character can control multiple trees of nodes, and the easy to use settings system lets you define common configuration settings as scriptable objects for easy referencing.\


PhysKit AniBone can respond to global and local velocity changes as well as gravity, wind and collisions. Easily tune your settings for accurate and efficient simulation. Let PhysKit help you add some bounce to your game!\


PhysKit AniBone is included in PhysKit Complete. Save on all of Heathen Engineering's Physics tools with [PhysKit Complete](http://u3d.as/1eLA)!
