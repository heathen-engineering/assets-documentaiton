## Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
Effectively the inverse of [Attract Effect](attract-effect.md)
{% endhint %}

A basic configurable effect which applies its force away from the origin of the Force Effect source. The mode by which force is applied is configurable in the settings of the effect.

## Angular

If enable and listening the Angular effect will attempt to rotate the subject to face away from the force origin.

## Linear

Simply applies the force in the opposing direction of the origin.
