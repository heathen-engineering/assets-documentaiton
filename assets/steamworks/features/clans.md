The Steam Clan, aka Steam Group system is part of Valve's Steam Friend system. Player's can freely create clans which work similar to guilds in MMOs in that they have a roster, officers, can run events and have a dedicated chat system that is always accessible to members.

Heathen's Clan Tools simplify Valve's clan interface features. It maintains a list of the player's clans and each clans member ship which can be refreshed on demand. Clan chat can be interacted with through code, though in general its advised to use the Steam Overlay as Clan chat can be very complex on account of the large number of users and that a player may interact with the chat from a wide range of sources such as Steam Client, Web Browser, Mobile App, Overlay or of 3rd party apps and games.
