## Introduction

Steam Microtransactions (In-Game Purchases) are handled via the [Steam Inventory](../features/inventory/) feature. We have multiple articles and a significant number of tools set up around [Steam Inventory](../features/inventory/).

The [Steam Inventory](../features/inventory/) system can be used for a number of things not just MTX. If you are interested in using Steam for MTX then it is [Steam Inventory](../features/inventory/) that you will be using to define your items, establish there prices, start purchases and detect what items the user owns.
