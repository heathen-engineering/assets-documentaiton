```
https://github.com/heathen-engineering/SourceRepo.git?path=/Steamworks/com.heathen.steamworkscomplete
```

GitHub will prompt you to login if you haven't already, this is how it checks to make sure your a sponsor and have access to the repo. Once done it will install Steamworks and any required dependencies.
