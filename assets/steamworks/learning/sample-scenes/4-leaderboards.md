## Objects

### Manager

The manage game object has the [Steamworks Behaviour](../../components/steamworks-behaviour.md) component attached and will handle initialization of the Steam API on start up.

A [Leaderboard Manager](../../components/leaderboard-manager.md) component is attached and configured to use the Feet Traveled [Leaderboard Object](../../objects/leaderboard.md).

### Feet Traveled

From Example Steam Settings as `[LdrBrd] Feet Traveled` this is used to update the leaderboard score and rank

### DEMO SCRIPTS

This contains internal demo scripts used in the scene which are all marked as deprecated. They simply drive the buttons in the menu nothing more.

The demo script works with the [Leaderboard Manager](../../components/leaderboard-manager.md) to upload scores and to handle query results in order to populate the result UI
