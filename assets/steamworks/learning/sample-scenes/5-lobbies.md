## Objects

### Manager

The manage game object has the [Steamworks Behaviour](../../components/steamworks-behaviour.md) component attached and will handle initalization of the Steam API on start up.

The manage also has a [Lobby Manager](../../components/lobby-manager.md) component attached which handles the create, search and join of a lobby.

The manage also has a[ Lobby Chat Director](../../components/lobby-chat-director.md) component attached which handles the send and receive of chat through the connected lobby if any

### DEMO SCRIPTS

This contains internal demo scripts used in the scene which are all marked as depricated. They simply drive the buttons in the menu nothing more.

The only feature of relivence in the demo scripts is a Join method which reads the text in the InputField and hands it off to the [Lobby Manager](../../components/lobby-manager.md) which will attempt to parse the text to a valid Lobby ID and join the lobby if possible.

It is not a typical use case to type in a lobby ID but is used here to enable developers to test mutliple members joining the same lobby.
