# ☝ Quick Start

## Knowledge Base Layout

First thing is first this knowledge base has tons of information and whatever question you may have is probably already answered with pictures, samples and detailed descriptions in this knowledge base ... but finding it might be a challenge.

Understanding how the Knowledge Base is laid out can help!

### Layout

:eyes: Look to your left\
See that list of headers over there?\
That is the Navigation Panel

Now look to your right :point\_right:\
See that list of headers over there?\
That is the contents for this page.

### Navigation Panel

The Navigation panel is split into 3 main groups.

#### Top

No name this just holds general stuff applicable to the Knowledge Base over all ... like how you can support the knowledge base and get all of Heathen's assets as a perk by becoming a [GitHub Sponsor](../../../become-a-sponsor/)!

#### Guides

The guides section has all sorts of general game development information in it covering everything from getting started as an indie game developer with our Indie Check List, to detailed articles on every aspect of [Steam](../../../company/steam/) not just the [Steamworks APIs](../../../company/steam/steamworks/) but including that as well, to guides on [programming](../../../company/development/), [game design](../../../company/design/) and more!

#### Assets

Where you are right now!\
The assets section is the product documentation for each of Heathen's assets and covers things like how to install (for [Unity](../unity/installation/) or [Godot](../for-godot-game-engine/installation.md)), [troubleshooting](../for-unity-game-engine/editor-tools.md), documenting [all the code](../api/) and [sample scenes](../unity/samples/) and so on!

### Contents

The contents panel on the right side is more bespoke and its layout will very depending on the article your reading.

## Guides

So if your reading this then your probably working with or thinking about working with Steamworks in your game project.&#x20;

Your very first step should be to learn what Steam is (and is not) and how it might benefit your game project. It is so much more than just a store and does so much more than whatever feature you think you want to use.

Our [Guide on Steam](../../../company/steam/) should be your first stop before you even purchase our asset, but its never to late to stop by now and read up!&#x20;

Be sure to read up on the [Steamworks feature](../../../company/steam/steamworks/) of Steam in particular, Steamworks is a huge powerful tool that requires understanding to use effectively. Its the Steamworks feature that is the tools and systems that you can integrate into your game.

## Documentation

Heathen's Steamworks is our Steam integration and is available for [Godot](../godot.md) (Foundation only) and [Unity](../unity/) (Complete and Foundation). The asset has features that are common all supported engines like the [API](../api/) and [Data Layer](../data-layer/). As well as features that are unique to each engine like Unity's [UI Components](../unity/ugui-tools/ui-components/).

The documentation found under the [Heathen Assets > Steamworks](../), is documentation on how to use our tools. If you are looking for guides on how to do something such as how you would set up [Multiplayer in a Steam](../../../company/steam/steamworks/multiplayer/) game then read our [Guides section](../../../company/steam/).
