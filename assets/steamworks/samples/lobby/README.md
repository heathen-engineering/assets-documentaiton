We provide two sample scenes for Lobby.

### Practical Use Case

This scene demonstrates a real world use case for a typical menu scene in a multiplayer game. Here we use Steam Lobby to provide 2 important features for our theoretical game.

#### [Party](party-group-lobby.md)

Using a steam lobby we can let players for a group or party with there friends where they can chat and find matches to play together. A party represents a group of friends that wish to play together and should not be confused for a "session" as a session may have multiple parties of friends and solo players join it.

#### [Session](session-lobby.md)

Using a steam lobby we can enable players to find sessions (aka matches) to join or to create a new session for others to join. A session represents a game play session also called a match. This contains the players that will be playing together in a networked session and may consist of individual aka solo players and or groups of players.

### [Session Lobby](session-lobby.md)

This is a simplified example containing only the session lobby and removing every non-crucial feature from it such as chat, authentication, friends list and friend invite. If you find the Practical Use Case scene a bit overwhelming then start here. This scene uses a trimmed down version of the [Session Lobby](session-lobby.md) but the concepts remain the same.
