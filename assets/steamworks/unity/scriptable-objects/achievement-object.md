## Introduction

```csharp
public class AchievementObject : ScriptableObject
```

The AchievementObject is generated by importing achievements from the Steam Developer Portal. You do this by selecting your Steam Settings object and expanding the Achievements section and clicking the Import button.

{% hint style="info" %}
The simulation must be running (click Play in Unity) in order for this to work&#x20;



This is becuase the Steam API must be initalized and updating to return results

### Unlock

```csharp
public void Unlock();
```

```csharp
public void Unlock(CSteamID user);
```

Unlocks the achievement for the local user or if on a game server pass in the user ID to unlock the achievement for a specific user.&#x20;

The server version (takes the user paramiter) will only work from Steam Game Servers and only when the indicated user has been authenticated.

When in a client build this is the same as&#x20;

```csharp
achievement.IsAchieved = true;
```

### ClearAchievement

```csharp
public void CLearAchievement();
```

```csharp
public void ClearAchievement(CSteamID user);
```

Clears the achievement state for the local user in client builds (do not pass the user paramiter). For server builds you would pass in the user paramiter to clear the achievement for the indicated user. The server version (takes the user paramiter) will only work from Steam Game Servers and only when the indicated user has been authenticated.

### GetAchievementStatus

```csharp
public bool GetAchievementStatus(CSteamID user);
```

Gets the achievement state for this achievement for the indicated user. This is only available from Steam Game Servers and only when the indicated user has been authhenticated and its states requested. See the [API.StatsAndAchievements](../../api/stats-and-achievements.md) interface for details

### Store

```csharp
public void Store()
```

This simply calls `StatsAndAchievements.Client.StoreStats()` and is only used on client builds to store any updated stats and achievements to the backend.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
You should not call this every time you update the value of a stat or achievement. The inteded purpose from Valve is that you can update your stats and acheivements in real time during gameplay and then at key points such as at the end of a mission or similar store those stats to the backend.



The notification of a stat or achievemnt being updated only happens when you call store  stats or when the game closes.



The Store Stats funciton is rate limited so if you call it to frequiently the Steam API will ignore you.
