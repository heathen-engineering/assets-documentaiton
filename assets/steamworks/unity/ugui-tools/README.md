## Overview

Heathen's Steam uGUI Tools is a collection of UI components that solves for common use cases with regards to game UI and Steam. For example the kit includes Friend Group which loads the local user's friends much like the Steam client's Friend List, our Friend List is a bit more game practicle it lists all friends that match your chossen filter option e.g. Online, Offline, In Game, etc. making it trival to set up your own Friend UI.

The following articles detail each of the available controls and how they are used. Everything in the kit is built with extension and expansion in mind so you can easily create your own controls based on our interfaces.
