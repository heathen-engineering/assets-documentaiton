### Steamworks Complete Plugin

{% hint style="info" %}
We are in the process of migrating Steamworks Complete to Unreal at times the documentation may be ahead of the plugin or behind a bit ... for any questions see our [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/463483739612381204/1153799474620137483).

* Full native Steamworks SDK for both C++ and Blueprints\
  Unlike Unreal's existing solutions `Steam Core` and `Online Subsystem Steam`, Heathen's Steamworks Complete is the full Steamworks SDK, every feature, every endpoint, and every callback.
* Battle-tested systems\
  10+ years developing for Steam supporting thousands of developers shipping hundreds of games. Heathen's Steamworks Complete is much more than just another Steam wrapper. We handle the boilerplate for you, we provide game-ready systems for common use cases, and we enable you to Do More!
* Rich Knowledge Base\
  Steam API is known for its ... sparse ... documentation. Heathen steps in and delivers more than lists of functions and members. We have guides, tips, tricks, best practices and more not just for our own tools but Steam as a platform and game development in general. We are your go-to resource.
* Live Community / Support\
  Join a community of fellow developers working across multiple engines. We provide live support and real-time conversation supporting not just our own tools but fostering a helpful and supportive community around Steam and game development in general.
