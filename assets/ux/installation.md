# Installation

UX Complete and the extension package uGUI Extras are both standard Unity assets that do not require any special installation steps. Simply import the assets from the Unity Asset Store / Package Manager and your done.

{% hint style="info" %}
UX and all related assets DO work with both the old and new input systems.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
In recent updates Unity has changed the process for enabling the "New" input system such that toggling the Player Settings to use the "New" input system does **NOT** install the input system package.



You must install the Input Package system from the Package Manager your self to get it to work. Our asset is coded to use either the new or the old depending on which is installed. If you set the Project Settings to use the "New" input system without installing it from the Package Manager then you will get compiler errors.&#x20;
