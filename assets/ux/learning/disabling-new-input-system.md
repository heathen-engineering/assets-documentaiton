# Disabling New Input System

## Introduction

This article will take you through the steps to disbale / remove the "New" Input System and to return to using the "Old" Input System.

## Step 1

Remove the Input System from the Package Manager ... we like to do this first even though it will throw a compiler error we find it faster/nicer to remove it before toggling the setting as the setting will force a restart.

As noted this will cause two exceptions or more to be thrown ... this is expected and will be resolved in the next step.

This happens because your settings still say to use the New Input System ... but you dont have the New Input System installed.

## Step 2

Toggle your Player Settings to use the "Old" Input System.&#x20;

NOTE

This will restart Unity
