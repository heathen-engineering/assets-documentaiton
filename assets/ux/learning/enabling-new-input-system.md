# Enabling New Input System

## Introduction

This article will walk through the steps to enable the new Input System and the common troublshooting issues

## Step 1

Install the new input system from the Package Manager. You should do this before you change your project settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
NOTE

Doing this (installing the Input System) should cause Unity to toggle the New Input System on for you so you can usually skip Step 2.

## Step 2

Enable the new input system in your project settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
NOTE

Usually Unity will do this for you when you install the Input System as done in Steam 1 so this should already be done for you.
{% endhint %}
