## Objects

### Managers

This GameObject implaments the Cursor Animator which is responsible for updating the cursors animation.

### Window Style

This GameObject located under the Canvas GameObject implaments the [Mouse Over Cursor State](../../components/mouse-over-cursor-state.md) setting the active state to Win Normal.

### Mac Style

This GameObject located under the Canvas GameObject implaments the [Change Cursor Default State](../../components/change-cursor-default-state.md) setting the default cursor state to Mac Normal on enter and Win Normal on exit.

### Generic Style

This GameObject located under the Canvas GameObject implaments the [Change Cursor Default State](../../components/change-cursor-default-state.md) setting the default cursor state to Generic White on enter and Win Normal on exit.

### Style Controls

In each of the grey boxes represeing a cursor style you will see a number of buttons, input fields, etc. You can mouse over these to see various cursors. The top most button implaments a [Button Cursor State](../../components/button-cursor-state.md) componenet which sets the state to one value on enter and a different value on mouse down. While other controls implament the simpler [Mouse Over Cursor State](../../components/mouse-over-cursor-state.md) which simply changes the state on enter and exit.
