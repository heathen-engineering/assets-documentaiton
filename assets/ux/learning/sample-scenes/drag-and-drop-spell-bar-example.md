## Introduction

## Objects

### Types

The "Types" and "Filter Types" fields of Drag Item and Drop Container respectivly take Scriptable Objects. That is we use Scriptable Objects as unique identifiers to power our filtering system. This is better than simple strings in that comparing two Scriptable Objects is faster and less error prone than comparing two strings. We use the same system in the [Heathen Behaviour](../../../system-core/scriptable-tags.md) to tag behaviours.

You can use any Scriptable Object you would like to represent a type. We have create a simple empty Scriptable Object called a [Scriptable Tag](../../../system-core/scriptable-tags.md) which we use in this scene. [Scriptable Tag](../../../system-core/scriptable-tags.md) has no long and not data it simply represents a unique referencable identifier.

### Spells

These are Drag and Drop items configured with types similar to the Items in the Inventory exmaple.
