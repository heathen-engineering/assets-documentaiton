uGUI Extras is a collection of extensions, tools and systems built specificly for Unity's uGUI framework. These tools can help you deliver a richer user experience with your projects UI and fills the gaps between Unity's built in controls and projects needs.

uGUI Extras is a standalone product that builds on top of Heathen's System Core. No additional purchas or installation is required.

## Features

### [Key Collection](key-collection.md)

Lets you create keyboards, pin pads, alien computer consoles or really any collection of "keys" as a simple Unity UI object.

### [Tree View Collection](tree-view.md)

Simplifies the creation of tree view controlls and makes it easy to manage tree views by expressing the data of the collection as GameObjects in your scene hierarchy.

### [Ligature Library](ligature-tools.md#ligature-library)

Lets you define character combinations and the result character enabling Key Collection inputs for Korean, Japanese and other ligature based character sets as well as common use extended characters such as translating ( c ) to ©

### Scroll Rect Helper

Extends Unity’s uGUI ScrollRect features enabling you to scroll to a specific item on demand and page navigate (scroll the width or height of the view)

## Installation

There are no special considerations when installing UX V2's uGUI Extras. Simply import from the Unity Package Manager and enjoy.
