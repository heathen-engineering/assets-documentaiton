# üòç Become a Sponsor

## [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/heathen-engineering)

{% embed url="https://github.com/sponsors/heathen-engineering" %}

Becoming a [sponsor of Heathen on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/heathen-engineering) is the best way to support us and enable us to deliver more articles, videos, tools, examples, support, and just more!

{% hint style="success" %}
Sponsoring Heathen at the $15 Monthly (or greater ü§™) [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/heathen-engineering) tier is the best way to get all of our great assets.

\
You can cancel your subscription at any time and keep using the assets you installed. Our [license](heathen-license-agreement.md) **does not** expire when you cancel your subscription.\
\
Cancelling your subscription only removes your ability to access the Source Repository so if later you want or need updates you can simply sub for another month at your leisure.
{% endhint %}

Sponsors starting at the $15 a month tier gain access to our Source Repository.

### How is it Better?

* **Lower price point**\
  Even if you maintain your $15 sponsorship indefinitely we would have to go **2 years** with **zero (0)** major updates and **zero (0)** new assets for the Unity Asset Store's perpetual license to break even (_as good of a price, not better_). Even then you wouldn't get the exclusives, instant updates or improved support.
* **Better support**\
  As a $15 or greater sponsor you have access to our issue tracking and feedback tools within GitHub as well as priority attention. Any requests or issues you post will get seen first and sorted first as you're accessing our source directly.
* **Faster updates**\
  As you are reading from the source there is no delay at all between us fixing a problem or making an update or addition and you having access to it.
* **First Access and Exclusives**\
  Some of our tools like uGUI Tools for Steam are exclusive to GitHub Sponsors as they don't fit well on Unity Asset Store. Other tools like Breakable Wood Props do make it to Unity Asset Store later and often in some reduced capacity due to the Asset Store's limitations.
* **Managed dependencies** \
  On GitHub, we distribute through Package Manager, which means we can define dependencies and have them resolved and installed for you.
* **More flexible license** \
  Our license is designed to be friendly to Indies and is yours to keep even if you cancel your sub.\
  Did you hire a contractor?\
  With our license that is no problem your license extends to them while they work for you\
  With Unity Asset Store license that contractor must also license the assets you use.&#x20;
* **Gain instant access to all our tools**\
  Discover more ways to Do More with Heathen. UX for example can improve and benefit just about any project. You probably didn't know we had it, if you did you probably weren't sure how it could help in your project but now it's there, part of the sponsorship, take a look and see how you can do more!

### What's Included?

Eventually everything except (maybe) our large art assets ‚Ä¶ and if we can find a way to ship them on GitHub Sponsor we will. Even GitHub has its limitations and large single files are one of them.

At current the following are present

* Toolkit for Steamworks SDK ( Unreal & Unity )
* PhysKit Complete
* Breakables Wood Props
* UX Complete
* uGUI Extras (On Screen Keyboard ... and more)

### The License

When you sponsor you gain the license documented [here](heathen-license-agreement.md), and when you end your subscription you still have whatever you downloaded and yes the [license](heathen-license-agreement.md) to go with it. You can re-sub when you need to catch up on updates or get that sweet sweet priority support ‚Ä¶ or maybe you just want to show your support for Heathen.
