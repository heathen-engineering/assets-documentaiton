# Evolution

Most topics in the codex will have some degree of evolution throughout history. That evolution can be expressed here and where needed may have many sub-articles providing as much or as little detail as is required to express the topic.

Sometimes evolution sees topics merge or split, sub articles can be links through to other topics creating a web of navigation.
