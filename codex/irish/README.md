## Contributors

Here we will name and reference any content contributors to these articles assuming they wish to be known. To be added here you must contribute content rather its pointing us to some published work, editing our sometimes horrible spelling and grammar or helping us organize the sections. People here did work to make this happen.

All names are listed in alphabetical order as the contributor wanted it to be. For a list of sources, e.g. those people and organizations who did the real work in research, archaeology, etc. see the [Sources ](research/wip/sources.md)article.
