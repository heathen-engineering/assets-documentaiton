# Banshee

This term translated most often as "woman of the fairy" or "fairy woman" first appears around 1400 CE in a time known to be hostile to the underlying Irish culture. Again the late 1800s CE efforts to suppress or supplant the tradition of keening seem to align with the appearance of the concept of a banshee.

The banshee found in various medieval works is likely inspired by a "keening woman" which is a human woman who wails or sings a lament in respect of the dead. This is not an uncommon practice in a few cultures and live recordings of Irish keeners from the 1950s are apparently available in the Irish Traditional Music Archive in Dublin.

The practice is or was effectively extinct in the Irish tradition though these records may be of relevance from a point of view of lore research.
