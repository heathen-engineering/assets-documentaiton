# Banshee

This term translated most often as "woman of the fairy" or "fairy woman" and first appears around 1400 CE in a time known to be hostile to the underlying Irish culture. In documents and notes of the time the banshee are said to be related to "true Milesians" by this they say they are referring to people's who sir name starts with O' or Mac which is another reference to a pseudo-historical view of Ireland and suggestive of the negative connection.

The banshee found in various medieval works is likely inspired by the concept of a "keening woman" which is a human woman who wails or sings a lament in respect of the dead. This is not an uncommon practice in a few cultures and live recordings of Irish keeners from the 1950s are apparently available in the Irish Traditional Music Archive in Dublin.

The practice is or was effectively extinct in the Irish tradition though these records may be of relevance from a point of view of lore research when understanding burial and ceremonial practices.
