# Celt

## Overview

No word is arbitrary and most ancient words are more descript than poetic it would seem.

The first use of the name "Celts" comes from a Greek geographer Hecataeus of Miletus in 517 BCE. In that text he is referring to a people living in southern Gaul and to the far west of Europe.

The etymology of Keltoi is unclear; a popular option that is supported by other historical and lore factors is that it is derived from a Celtic word similar to indo-European "kiel". This is supported by the prefix appearing in Celtic names such as Celtillus. The suggested meaning is "people or descendants of the hidden one". This ties into the Gauls claimed descent from an underworld or dead god.

During the Roman Gallic wars Julius Ceasar reported that the Gauls called themselves "Celts" this doesn't mean its a true "Celtic" word but does show that Celts called them selves Celts so the term is at least period for the culture in question.

## Are Irish Celtic?

Yes and no. Ireland is Ireland due to at least 3 possibly 4 notable migration events the latest of which in the bronze age does seem to be the most "Celtic" of them hence annotations from Romans such as Tactitus which says the Britons resembled the Gauls in customs and religion but didn't treat them as the same interestingly. As to rather or not the Irish should be considered Celt, the common idea is yes, the historical one is maybe and then the deeper you get into academics the more its a point of contention. For our purposes though its fair to say late bronze and early Iron age Ireland was more Celtic than not. When exploring folklore its also fair to say that the customs, symbology and other factors of Irish as far back as 2 or 3000 BCE is at least analogous to what we understand of "Celtic" folklore from the mainland. Rather the Irish flavour is unique because its different, more isolated, or simply not destroyed until much later .. if it is even all that unique at all is part of that pesky academic debate.

So what do we know?

### Megalithic Irish

10,000 to 12,000 BCE ... predates "Celtic"

The first group we haven't delved deeply into yet but would have had some impact on the culture and had the longest amount of time with the island before meeting new outsiders. This group of people where hunter gatherers and didn't leave us a lot in the way of archaeological evidence.

We are not yet sure where they would have migrated from so we don't even have a good idea of what known cultures would be related or even what they might have looked like.

### Neolithic Irish

aprox 6,000 BCE ... predates "Celtic"

This group we have some more information on mainly because they are denoted by building structures. They are the ones responsible for the initial major settlements such as Tara. Some foundational patterns such as time keeping and likely at least the "proto" aspects of the cultural relationship with concepts such as life, death, time, knowledge, etc. where probably started here given the permanence of the things they produced and remained in use well into the Iron age.

This culture seems to come from the Mediterranean via a migration from the south. We have genetic research that points to this from remains found in Ireland and dated to around 6 to 5000 BCE so the information is fairly stable. This also gives us a hint as to what these people at least came from and so how there views and customs might be "tented" with regards to their origins. In particular people from Crete are genetically most similar so it may be of interest to explore that migration to understand more about this earlier period.

### Bronze Age Irish

aprox 3000 BCE&#x20;

This is where we get into the "Celtic Debate" ...&#x20;

We will explore this more as required but only as it relates to folklore since we do not care about the historical aspect we will try to avoid the academic debate and keep it to matters of cultural lore. As far as the term Celtic and related terms this is an important term for the late bronze age and early Iron age, that is certain. The styling of generally agreed "Celtic" lore does seem to be prevalent in the mid to late bronze age in Ireland e.g. Druids, the unique measurement of time, aspects of language and at least some of the major deities.

Unfortunately the debate over this period and its culture has been a political one for the better part of 1500 years if not longer; and sadly still is dominated by various agendas beyond simply the pursuit of information. Detangling information available for this period to try and uncover the underlying folklore for bronze age Irish is the point of this codex. Our focus then will be on extracting the general concepts and features of the culture and leave the bickering over nuance and naming to people who need to publish academic papers in journals for a living.&#x20;
