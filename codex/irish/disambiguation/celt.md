# Celt

## Overview

No word is arbitrary and most ancient words are more descript than poetic it would seem.

The first use of the name "Celts" comes from a Greek geographer Hecataeus of Miletus in 517 BCE. In that text he is referring to a people living in southern Gaul and to the far west of Europe.

The etymology of Keltoi is unclear; a popular option that is supported by other historical and lore factors is that it is derived from a Celtic word similar to indo-European "kiel". This is supported by the prefix appearing in Celtic names such as Celtillus. The suggested meaning is "people or descendants of the hidden one". This ties into the Gauls claimed descent from an underworld or dead god.

During the Roman Gallic wars Julius Ceasar reported that the Gauls called themselves "Celts" this doesn't mean its a Celtic word but does show that Celts called them selves Celts

## Are Irish Celtic?

Yes and no. Ireland is Ireland due to at least 3 possibly 4 notable migration events the latest of which in the bronze age does seem to be the most "Celtic" of them hence annotations from Romans such as Tactitus which says the Britons resembled the Gauls in customs and religion but didn't treat them as the same.

### Megalithic Irish

10,000 to 12,000 BCE ... predates "Celtic"

The first group we haven't delved deeply into yet but would have had some impact on the culture and had the longest amount of time with the island before meeting new outsiders. This group of people where hunter gatherers and didn't leave us a lot in the way of archaeological evidence.

We are not yet sure where they would have migrated from so we don't even have a good idea of what known cultures would be related or even what they might have looked like.

### Neolithic Irish

aprox 6,000 BCE ... predates "Celtic"

This group we have some more information on mainly because they are denoted by building structures. They are the ones responsible for the initial major settlements such as Tara. Some foundational patterns such as time keeping and likely at least the "proto" aspects of the cultural relationship with concepts such as life, death, time, knowledge, etc. where probably started here given the permanence of the things they produced and remained in use well into the Iron age.

### Bronze Age Irish

aprox 3000 BCE&#x20;

This is where we get into the "Celtic Debate" ... the old idea is "Celtic" comes from the east and moves west as a culture\
\
The modern statement is it started in the west and is more "language" than culture



We will explore this more as it relates to folklore since we do not care about the historical aspect we are only concerned with what this means culturally.
