# Sovereignty Goddess

This is an academic or scholarly term common in Celtic studies. This term does not paint a full or accurate picture and is tinted by more modern political and religious agendas. As the term would not have been used nor the concept a relevant one for the people of the era we avoid this term our selves and scrutinize sources that use it to describe figures from Irish folklore.

Sex marriage and relationship between male and female has been a key political point for Christian culture and folklore; in particular in the eras when much of the lore we have and the pseudo-history available was written. Coupled with known and obvious attempts to damage, destroy, remove and supplant the underlying folklore we feel its best to approach this concept with a high degree of scrutiny.

Like most of what we have to work with there is (likely) some "lead" or information of relevance in this concept that may help us understand more though this concept in and of its self is accepted as modern and not of relevance for this codex.
