# The Morrígan

This term appears in a few era pseudo-historical works with the earliest references around 800 CE. It translates most commonly to "Great Queen" but is sometimes suggested to mean "Phantom Queen".&#x20;

If this term or persona was present in traditional Irish folklore (pre-500 CE) it was likely in relation to Goddesses of Sovereignty. The Morrigan in some stories is noted as a "triple goddess" and in others has two sisters sometimes sharing names with Fódla and Banba suggesting the Morrígan may be a stand in or recontextualization of Ériu.
