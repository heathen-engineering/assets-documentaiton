# The Morrígan

The Morrígan as seen in most modern examples comes from a Christian pseudo-History and is a fabrication having some hints of the underlying source but largely existing to supplant the indigenous lore.

Likely inspired by [Ériu](../folklore/characters/erui/) and related topics, the Morrígan refers or translates to "Great Queen" or similar. The main references are in regard to the Tuatha Dé Danann in particular with regards to the Milesians. Like most supplanting history/lore content it does have relatable elements to the underlying source but is its self a fiction and seemingly constructed to remove and replace what came before.
