# The Morrígan

This term appears in a few era pseudo-historical works with the earliest references around 800 CE. It translates most commonly to "Great Queen" but is sometimes suggested to mean "Phantom Queen". This term is as a reference to a specific character in Irish folklore is likely not relevant for Irish folklore but a construct of later pseudo-historical works. That said the referenced figure/figures are most relatable to [Érui ](../folklore/characters/erui/)which is a personification for the Island its self.
