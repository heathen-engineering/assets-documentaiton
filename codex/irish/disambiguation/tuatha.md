# Tuatha

So you have probably heard of the Tuatha Dé Danann or some variant there of.&#x20;

Try as we might we haven't found any support for this concept coming from the early era. This seems to be a medieval construction identifying the entities that where in Ireland predating the Christians. Like the concept of the Milesians this is a fabrication of the middle ages and seem to be primarily concerned with linking Irish heritage with general Christian lore likely for political means.

The term Tuatha Dé meaning something akin to "the people of god" was being used by in a few places, Tuatha Dé Danann was referring to "the people of the goddess Danu". In particular the Tuatha Dé Danann are said to have been supressed by various means made or choosing to live below or general not in this world any longer. This was done by the Milesians supposedly who are them selves from Hispania and related to Noah in some way.

The earliest examples of these notes come from the 11th century CE and where not widely used until the 18th century CE. Like most supplanting history/lore content it does have relatable elements to the underlying source but is its self a fiction and seemingly constructed to remove and replace what came before.
