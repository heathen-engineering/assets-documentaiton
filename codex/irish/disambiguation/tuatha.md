# Tuatha

Tuatha Dé Danann and Tuatha Dé are common enough terms in a lot of Irish related folklore. The term translates

Tuatha Dé\
This term has been used by Irish monks to refer to Israelites meant to translate as "People of God" \
\
Tuatha Dé Danann\
This term appears in a few pseudo-historical works and translates as "People of the goddess Danann". The oldest references to this term appear to be from 1,100 CE bringing the relevance of the term in question with regards to the indigenous Irish folklore. Many figures said to be members of the Tuatha Dé Danann are represented in multiple sources and likely have some roots in the underlying folklore though the term its self seem to be a more modern structure.
