This figure is shown its self as a tricephalic figure (3 heads) and is or was a popular figure through the Celtic world. The Roman's knew of this figure and related it to Mercury.

Associated with the spear, shoes, dogs and various us iconography this particular figure should be relatively easy to digest into the codex.
