### Personal Notes

This one ... or 3 ... is younger than Dagda and in a few places is noted as the wife of grandchildren or Dagda or further younger than the generation of Dagda.

#### General

A [triple goddess](../../../../research/disambiguation/triple-persona.md) and often as a personification for the island it self.

It is a struggle to understand the overall function of this character beyond a general since of it being very important perhaps central.

Érui \
One part of the entity is the source of the modern name for the island

Fódla\
Hardly mentioned as a figure of its own but often sited in poems to refer to the island or its people or its leadership.&#x20;

Banba\
Noted frequently but never really discussed and the etymology like with Fódla is either highly generic or out right missing.
