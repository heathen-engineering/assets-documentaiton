### Personal notes

Possibly but not defiantly part of "The Dagda" ... some times just called Donn or Eber Donn or Dagda Donn.

Donn seems derived from dhuosnos which seems to be proto European or Celtic perhaps for "dark, shadow, night" or otherwise without light.

This persona is associated with death though in a positive light such as a keeper of the place of the dead, king of the land of the dead or similar. A modern view might tend to sway this is "edgy" or evil based on the fear of death though research suggests a calming, comforting "don't fear death because of this" as opposed to "fear death because of this"&#x20;
