So we need to pin down when Érui became a concept in Irish lore as this will impact how she would have been thought of.

In short there are 3 very different "looks" for the people of Ireland that correspond to ages / eras.&#x20;

Érui is treated as the personification of the Island and is noted by several sources as a triple deity likely at least part of the inspiration for the modern concept of "The Morrígan"
