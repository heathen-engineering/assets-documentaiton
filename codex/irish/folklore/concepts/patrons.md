# Patrons

This as a term doesn't appear in stories but the concept its self does. In various northern stories heroes and younger "gods" are often said to have a "patron", this concept can be carried further to everyone having or choosing a main figure or concept for example a Norse hero may assoceate with Heimdall, Tyr or Thor.

In Irish folklore we occasionally see examples such as Éthur Mac Cuill which means (Éthur the son of the Hazel) treating Hazel (a sacred tree) as Éthur's patron ... Éthur's father is said to be Cermait a son of Dagda. This also suggests a personification of the sacred trees.
