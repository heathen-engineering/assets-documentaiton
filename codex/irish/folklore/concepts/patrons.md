The concept is simply that one may have an affinity toward a specific deity or spirt and may style their life and even their name for it such as Mac Coll meaning ( Son of the Hazel ). This doesn't suggest that Mac Coll is literally the son of Hazel but that Coll ( Hazel ) is his patron god or spirit.
