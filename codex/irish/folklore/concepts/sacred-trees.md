Bile or sacred trees are just that trees seen as sacred and associated with various properties. The trees them selves or rather the type may also be personified as a Déi for example Coll is often personified as a character with other characters styling them selves as descendent from it e.g. Mac Coll for example.

The trees them selves are seen as sacred and associated with various properties, this ties into the more practical aspects of religion / life teaching for the Druids. 7 types of trees are commonly noted.
