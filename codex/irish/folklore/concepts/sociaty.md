### Gender

Gender does not define what one can become, do or aspire to nor what is expected of one. A woman who is wronged or abused is encouraged to seek her own justice or vengeance as would any other person be. Anyone regardless of gender can become a leader, warrior, druid or fill any other role. Performance and competency are more important than other factors.

### Heredity&#x20;

As with gender this just didn't seem to matter, who your parents where could be a social point for you but would not grant or forbid roles, positions, etc. Leadership for example was not handed down, rather leaders where chosen among the people.

### Hospitality

Guest must be treated well, offered food, comfort and curtesy and should not be pressed for information or payment.

### Leadership

Leadership is earned by the worthy not inherited by the child

### Sex

There are no taboos of note regarding sex or sexuality. Sex can be personal, private and intimate or open and recreational, partners may be singular or many and of any gender or strata.
