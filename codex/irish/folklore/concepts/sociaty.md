### Gender

Gender has no impact on what one can become, do or aspire to nor what is expected of one. A woman who is wronged or abused is encouraged to seek her own justice or vengeance as would any other person be.

### Hospitality

Guest must be treated well, offered food, comfort and curtesy.

### Leadership

Leadership is earned by the worthy not inherited by the child

### Sex

There are no taboos of note regarding sex or sexuality. Sex can be personal, private and intimate or simply recreational, partners may be singular or many and of any gender or strata.
