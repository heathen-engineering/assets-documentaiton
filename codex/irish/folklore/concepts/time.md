## Seasons

The two main seasons are more important to daily life than the specifics of the month. Months where less "months" as we think of them and more a measure of how far into the current half of the year one was.

### Winter

We start here; Samhain to Bealtaine

### Summer

Second half of the year Bealtaine to Samhain

## Year

A year is relevant as far as the spring and fall equinox and then the longest and shortest days of the solar year. As the months are lunar a means to reconcile the lunar cycle with the solar is handled as 235 lunar months in 19 solar years. This pattern is prevalent on carvings as old as the middle and late stone age though the bronze and into early Iron age, we are quite sure this was common knowledge which suggest the means to measure and use it was also common.
