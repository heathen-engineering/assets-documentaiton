# Triple Persona

A persona often though not always a deity such as a goddess or god which appears in three forms.&#x20;

## Deities

Among the Celts orders of 3 are most common. The "mother" or "mothers" are a common site on alters and shrines usually represented as 3 figures but can be expressed as 27 (3 \* 3 \* 3).

In many examples of triple gods and goddesses each individual persona represents a key factor or niche such as (War, Industry, Religion), (Creation, Destruction, Preservation), (Past, Present, Future), etc. The unified character of the 3 persona can be presented as a unique 4th character or simply as a summation of the three if presented at all.
