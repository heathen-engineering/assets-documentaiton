### Personal Notes

I find a few mentions of this in random places, not sure if its a modern thing we assume ancient Irish would have done ... or if its an old thing we still do.

Elder is known to contain a number of toxins so it may well be that it was avoided by our ancestors but it was also a culturally significant plant and one that appears as an ingredient throughout historical record.&#x20;
