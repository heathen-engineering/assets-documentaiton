# Elderberry Wine

### Personal Note

Never had a wine made from elderberry not sure if it would work out. I have however had elderberry wine which is absolutely wonderful stuff.

Need to do some research to see&#x20;

A) Was elderberry wine actually made and associated with Samhain at all

B) If it was ... is this elderberry "wine" as in made only from the berry or is it elderberry mead being honey mead flavoured with elderberry ... its also possible that this was done with elderflower which is also tasty
