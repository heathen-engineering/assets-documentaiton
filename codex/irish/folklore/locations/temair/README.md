This is an endangered historical site\
\
[https://heritageireland.ie/places-to-visit/hill-of-tara/](https://heritageireland.ie/places-to-visit/hill-of-tara/)

A critically important location since at least the late stone age and through to the early Christian era. While the treatment of the hill of Tara is marred with blind short sighted greed the site is still present ... for now.
