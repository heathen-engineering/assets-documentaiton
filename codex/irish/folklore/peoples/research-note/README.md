# Research Note

{% hint style="info" %}
The history is not the point of this Codex.\
These notes exist to help detangle the pseudo-History/lore from the 10th through modern day from the preceding "indigenous" lore that came before.

By understanding the factual evolution of the island's peoples we might better sort native folklore from the supplanting fiction.

DNA research and archaeological evidence supports the notion of at least 3 major immigration/migration events coming to Ireland. These roughly translate to&#x20;

1. Hunter Gathers
2. Neolithic Farmers
3. Bronze Age

Each of the three denotes a sudden change in technology and population makeup. That is each of the three are distinctly different populations genetically. We are currently researching to understand how this archaeological fact may be manifested in the early Irish folklore.

### Notes

Interesting evidence suggesting a bronze age flow of peoples from the central area of Eurasia to the north west tend to be tied into the DNA findings for the bronze age Irish ... that is showing a genetic link with southern Russia and similar. While we are not concerned with the historical aspect this may be useful in detangling the more modern Christian pseudo-history and lore from the pre-existing folklore by looking to the near relations of the people of Ireland and understanding how their folklore evolved over time.
