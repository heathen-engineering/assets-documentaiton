### Personal Notes

Not much reference to this one, only note found is that this may be similar to Ymir and perhaps part of a now lost Irish creation myth. This assumption assumes that the Irish creation myth is similar to that of the Nord which it may well be but more research is needed.

Other Celtic cultures exist so searching for Welsh, pre-Roman French, etc. creation myths or similar may help clarify this one.
