# Name

### Personal Notes

Ban = woman, female, wife ... generally feminine

ba = a connecting word used in a factual past tense like "is" which doesn't make since so we either are missing some of the name or have the name wrong ... or have the translation wrong.

"Death" feminine derivative?

War association ... but most northern tribes associated war and battle strength with most important figures.

Possibly related to the concept of "Val" as seen in Germanic/Nordic ? i.e. "death in battle"
