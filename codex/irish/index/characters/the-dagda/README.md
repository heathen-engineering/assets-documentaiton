# The Dagda

### Personal notes

Often compared to Odin or similar and some variant names include "Ollathair" "All father" which seems more a butchery of "Valfather" which doesn't mean "all father" it means "father of those slain in battle"

This figure seems to be a [triple god](../../../disambiguation/triple-persona.md) or at least appears to have had multiple persona at one point
