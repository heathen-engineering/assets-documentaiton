# Bronze Age

A 3rd population with archaeological support is more akin to the modern Irish and appears around 5000 BCE.

As with other immigrations intermixing is indicated, like with the Neolithic Farmers the popular thought at the moment is that this was a sudden shift in terms of technology and culture and resulted in a new age and new people.



### Personal Notes

A lot of research in folklore talks of multiple tribes distinct in appearance and of intermarriage between them. One has to wonder if this is a living memory of one or more of these migration events and the period of merger that would have followed.&#x20;

Not just understanding who the migrants where but also why they where migrating and how they migrated might further help detangle the folklore. It is suggested that at least this later bronze age migration was significant so one has to think it would impact cultural stories in some way.
