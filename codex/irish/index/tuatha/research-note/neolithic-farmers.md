# Neolithic Farmers

Archaeological evidence puts a unique population at around 6000 BCE who where Neolithic Farmers and where immigrants to Ireland from the south likely through Spain. This population is most similar in appearance to modern people in Sardinia. Traces of the previous population are noted in DNA research but not a significant amount.

The romantic idea is conflict (epic battles) but it seems more likely that a tiny hunter gather population was simply supplanted as the most abundant population by the more populous and stable farming population. As is always the case there is sign of intermingling so whatever the relationship between them the result was a new age and a new people.
