Folklore is really messy ... like all good things

In particular Irish folklore is very hard to dig through hence this resource existing at all ... but you probably came here with some existing knowledge about Ireland or its folklore ... so in the sections below you will find references to the modern pop-culture folklore that attempt to help clarify and point you to the related articles in our codex.

In particular most "modern" Irish folklore is derived from middle age Christian pseudo-History. Like most supplanting history/lore content it does have relatable elements to the underlying source but is its self a fiction and seemingly constructed to remove and replace what came before. A notable effort of this codex is to attempt and detangle that more modern twist from its source for a better and clearer understanding.
