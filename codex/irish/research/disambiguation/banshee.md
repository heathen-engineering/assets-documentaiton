# Banshee

This term translated most often as "woman of the fairy" or "fairy woman" and seems to first appears around 1400 CE.

This is suspected to be a medieval construct based on the concept of a "keening woman" relating to a burial practice of the indigenous culture and similar to common practices in other cultures.
