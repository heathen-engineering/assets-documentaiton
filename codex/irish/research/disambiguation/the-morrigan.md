This term appears in a few pseudo-historical works with the earliest references around 800 CE. It translates most commonly to "Great Queen" but is sometimes suggested to mean "Phantom Queen".&#x20;

Additional research is needed to understand if this term is a construct of medieval pseudo-history, a derived or amalgamated figure or concept or if it is an echo of a traditional figure or concept.
