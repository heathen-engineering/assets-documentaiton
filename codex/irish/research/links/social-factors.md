# Social Factors

Archaeological evidence coupled with annotations from Greek and Roman sources paint a picture common proto-Celtic and later Celtic culture's social factors.

### Druids

Proto-Celtic "Oak Knower" highlights the importance of trees and the general factor of wisdom.  Not just priests ... but also priests. If we consider three common classes or groups such as Warrior, Druid and Worker then we can reword this to mean (Warrior, Scholar and Worker). Druids defiantly served a religious role but also, poets, healers, architects and generally the wisdom of the tribe. Male and female could be druids, as noted gender segregation seems to be the oddity of Roman, Greek and related cultures and was not a feature of more northern European tribes.

### Gender

We have many archaeological examples and documented occurrences of male and female persons in every role and every strata of society. Female and male alike where warriors, druids, leaders, workers, artisans, wealthy, pore, slave and master.

Gender appears important for its symbolic uses and for procreation but seems to have no barring at all with regards to the path of ones life. The concept of inhibited or limited female social opportunities seems limited to Roman, Greek and related cultures but was not a feature of proto-Celtic, Celtic and further northern and eastern tribes.

This is an interesting discovery as the common thought is of either matriarchal or patriarchal societies throughout "civilized history" it however seems that such gender elevation or suppression as your point of view may be is the oddity not the norm as is limited to Roman, Greek and related culture groups for the period in question.

### Hospitality

We have numerous notes from both the Greek and the Roman of Celtic hospitality and reason to believe this feature was present in proto-Celtic owing to it being prevalent in other cultural groups derived from the same sources.

No group of the age is known as particularly inhospitable but the notes for these norther tribes of Europe by the people who saw them as enemy as being very hospitable and well "civilized" with regards to there treatment of guests is of note above and beyond what they felt was usual.

In may however be that the furious nature of war for proto-Celtic and Celtic peoples set an expectation of an inhospitable nature that simply contrasted with the experienced reality of a "civilized" (as described by the Greek) hospitality.

### Leadership

The understanding is that leadership was passed down to whom was deemed more worthy and was less a matter of heredity as we see in the later ages. Leadership selection and forms of governance that might be considered democrat have been noted by several sources. We do know that chiefs and kings do feature and that Druids where important for the process.

### Sex

We have many notes from Greek and Roman sources regarding sex having no taboos with the tribes we associate with proto-Celtic and Celtic. We also have notes with regards to Celtic women interacting with Roman women on the matter showing Celtic women where just as sexually liberal as the men.

We see a similar condition in various European tribes suggesting that sexual taboos and inhibition of female sexuality is a distinctly Mediterranean concept that doesn't apply to the tribes in question for our folklore research.
