This is a text of deliberate miss information\

Many sources treat this as "historical" or at least accurate folklore. It is however a complete fabrication in the same guise as other pseudo-historical works from the Christian efforts of the middle ages.\

It is assumed the content is in some level derived from an underlying folklore though it is understood that the intent of the work is to supplant the indigenous culture and tie the heritage of the population to a Christian friendly origin both chronologically and heretically.\

This work is a compilation or works starting as early as 800 CE and reaching its final form around 1100 CE
