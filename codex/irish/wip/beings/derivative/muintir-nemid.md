{% hint style="warning" %}
Muintir Nemid is likely a derivative post Christianisation attempting to link to Irish lore with the adopted Abrahamic lore. Further research required to confirm or refute this link.\


Stories related to Muintir Nemid seem derived from cannon due to a similarity in structure and naming with figures and concepts related to Tuatha DÃ© Danann which is generally accepted as cannon.
