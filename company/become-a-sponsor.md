# üòç Become a Sponsor

## Introduction

Becoming a [sponsor of Heathen on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/heathen-engineering) is the best way to support us and enable us to deliver more articles, videos, tools, examples, support and just more!

{% hint style="info" %}
Subscribing to Heathen as a $10 or more [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/heathen-engineering) is the best way to get

* Steamworks Complete
* PhysKit Complete
* UX Complete
* uGUI Extras (On Screen Keyboard)
* Breakables: Wood Props

and the only way to get exclusives like uGUI Tools for Steam.

\
You can cancel your subscription at any time and keep using the assets you installed. Our [license](heathen-license-agreement.md) **does not** expire when you cancel your subscription.\
\
Cancelling your subscription only removes your ability to access the Source Repository so if later you want or need updates you can simply sub for another month at your leisure.
{% endhint %}

## [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/heathen-engineering)

For small teams and indies this is really the best method for you and for Heathen.

Sponsors starting at the $10 a month tier gain access to our Source Repository.

### How is it Better?

* **Lower price point**\
  ****Even if you maintain your $10 sponsorship indefinitely we would have to go **2 years** with **zero (0)** major updates and **zero (0)** new assets in order for the Unity Asset Store's perpetual license to break even (_as good of a price, not better_). Even then you wouldn't get the exclusives, instant updates nor the improved support.
* **Better support**\
  As a $10 or greater sponsor you have access to our issue tracking and feedback tools within GitHub as well as priority attention. Any requests or issues you post will get seen first and sorted first as your accessing our source directly.
* **Faster updates**\
  As you reading from the source there is no delay at all between us fixing a problem or making an update or addition and you having access to it.
* **First Access and Exclusives**\
  Some of our tools like uGUI Tools for Steam are exclusive to GitHub Sponsors as they don't really fit well on Unity Asset Store. Other tools like Breakable Wood Props do make it to Unity Asset Store later and often in some reduced capacity due to the Asset Store's limitations.
* **Managed dependencies: (**_major failing the of Asset Store_**)**\
  On GitHub we distribute through Package Manager, which means we can define dependencies and have them resolve and install for you.
* **More flexible license: (**_major failing of the Asset Store_**)**\
  Our license is designed to be friendly to indies and is yours to keep even if you cancel your sub.\
  Did you hire a contractor?\
  With our license that is no problem your license extends to them while they work for you\
  With Unity Asset Store license that contractor must also license the assets you use.&#x20;
* **Gain instant access to all our tools**\
  ****Discover more ways to Do More with Heathen. UX for example can improve and benefit just about any project. You probably didn't know we had it, if you did you probably weren't sure how it could help in your project but now its there, part of the sponsorship, take a look and see how you can do more!

### What's Included?

Eventually everything except (maybe) our large art assets ‚Ä¶ and if we can find a way to ship them on GitHub Sponsor we will. Even GitHub has its limitations and large single files are one of them.

At current the following are present

* Steamworks Complete
* uGUI Tools for Steam (exclusive)
* PhysKit Complete
* Breakables Wood Props
* UX Complete
* uGUI Extras (On Screen Keyboard ... and more)

### The License

When you sponsor you gain the license documented [here](heathen-license-agreement.md), and when you end your subscription you still have whatever you downloaded and yes the [license](heathen-license-agreement.md) to go with it. You can re-sub when you need to catch up on updates or get that sweet sweet priority support ‚Ä¶ or maybe you just want to show your support for Heathen.
