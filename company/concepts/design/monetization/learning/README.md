## Motivators

How do you motivate your player to play your game?

This is a big topic that dips into topics along the Social Engineering line and well beyond the scope of our document but thinking about the motivations of your player's is key to your over all design. In particular this can play a big part in how you market and monetize your game.

{% hint style="success" %}
This complex topic is not served well by over simplification.\
You are strongly encouraged to research the impact motivation methods on users. You can find a fair bit of this sort of research specific to the game industry such as&#x20;

### Intrinsic

{% hint style="success" %}
Generally thought of as **Positive**
{% endhint %}

This refers to a motivator whose source is internal to the consumer e.g. self motivated. The simplest expression of this concept is "plays because they enjoy it" of course that isn't terribly useful for a designer. Another example would a highly organized player that "enjoys" organizing disorderly things, then the designer can present that user with disorderly things to organize and the means to organize it.

{% hint style="success" %}
This leans into the idea that a game should **NOT** be designed for the widest audience possible. You should select a specific audience and design a game that plays to their intrinsic motivators.\
\
The wider your audience the harder it is to construct a play loop that effectively engages/motivates the player intrinsically.
{% endhint %}

### Extrinsic

{% hint style="danger" %}
Generally thought of as **Negative**
{% endhint %}

This refers to a motivator whose source is external to the consumer e.g. the motivations is "carrot or stick". Task lists, fear of missing out, peer pressure, etc. are all forms of extrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivators are far more easily applied to a broad audience set but generally result in a lower or even negative satisfaction response in the player.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It can be useful to apply an extrinsic motivator to encourage a player to try new or especially counter intuitive things where they may discover a new source of "fun" and joy. It is not true that all extrinsic motivation is "bad", but it certainly is true that we must be sparing and deliberate with its use.
{% endhint %}

Extrinsic motivators find their way into game design rather easily especially when constructing our monetization. Depending on our analytics we may mistakenly identify the results of these extrinsic motivators as a net positive for our player base as they do have a very strong motivation effect but a typically very negative satisfaction effect.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Your a gamer right?

Think of it like a game, intrinsic motivation is positive in effect but limited in use and utility, extrinsic is powerful in use and utility but negative in effect. You will need to find a balance unique to your game and your market.
{% endhint %}

#### Positive v Negative

Within extrinsic motivators we have two approaches (Positive / Negative), (Carrot / Stick), (Reward / Punishment). As with all things a balance is required, excessive positive / reward motivation devalues the effect of future rewards and creates and expectation of reward. Excessive negative motivation creates hyper emotive situations and tends to fuel hostile or toxic communities or out right drives the player away

**Positive Risks**

A major issue with positive or reward mechanics is that the strong motivator tends to override even intrinsic motivators further degrading the player's level of satisfaction. The effect of positive extrinsic motivators also creates an expectation of reward and a resulting "Negative" impact on motivation when a reward is not included further devaluing the effect of anything other than future positive extrinsic motivators.... the addiction effect.

**Negative Risk**

Risks with use of negative extrinsic motivators seems more obvious however they tend to be a safer option when compared to positive risks. For example leaderboards, world first and other competitive motivators are fundamentally negative motivators for most player types. This is not to say you are free to use and abuse negative motivations simply that the adverse impact on your game will generally be more manageable then with similar use of positive effects.

## [Monetization](../)

In the [Models ](../models/)section we outline the high level monetization structures you can apply to your project while the [Tools](../tools/) section outlines the monetization mechanisms that can be used to exploit those models. We do also document the clearly [predatory practices](../predatory-practices/) seen in our industry as well as those that are [vulnerable to predation](../vulnerable-practices/). In the following sections we will touch on a few key areas to study up and develop your project that aren't often associated with game design.

## Market Research

### What is it?

Simply researching or gathering information about your target customer's needs, preferences and expectations.

### How to do it?

The answer to that depends on your project and target markets. This should tell you that you first need at decent understanding of what your game will be and who it will be for. With that in hand you will gather information from available sources to effectively simulate or hypothesize how your game will do.

{% hint style="success" %}
What we have described here is a Historical Market Research approach and this is most common for indies due to a lack of other affordable options.\
\
If you have the budget you should select a marketing partner studio who can help you perform more "intelligent" market research. You may be surprised at just how "indie friendly" marketing partners can be if you do a bit digging. As an added bonus having a marketing partner and a budget to fuel them with can significantly boost project viability.
{% endhint %}

Your first requirement of course is to find a source of information.

{% embed url="https://vginsights.com/" %}

Their are plenty of resources available some free, some paid. VGI as linked above is a paid option and one we have used on several projects and is useful for PC games deploying on Steam.

{% embed url="https://steamspy.com/" %}

Steam Spy is another option for Steam and has a free option.

Once you have a source you need to identify similar projects to yours in that source and understand the audience they hit and how well. It can be useful to take a look at the other projects that are not similar to yours but that hit the same sorts of audience targets.

Your goal here is to try and abstract out a "typical customer" or more commonly several that represent your "target audiences".

Early in design it can also be useful to abstract out the "typical game" relevant for your project. This could be variations similar to what you have in mind and or variations of games that overlap with your target audiences.

With the "Typical Customers" and or "Typical Games" in hand you pull hypothetical numbers from your sources to give a feel for the "best case", "worst case" and "most probable". This may also help you adjust any areas of your design that where more \[ shrug emoji ] up to this point.
