## Introduction

In the [Models ](../models/)section we outline the high level monetization structures you can apply to your project while the [Tools](../tools/) section outlines the monetization mechanisms that can be used to exploit those models. We do also document the clearly [predatory practices](../predatory-practices/) seen in our industry as well as those that are [vulnerable to predation](../vulnerable-practices/).

## Market Research

### What is it?

Simply researching or gathering information about your target customer's needs, preferences and expectations.

### How to do it?

The answer to that depends on your project and target markets. This should tell you that you first need at decent understanding of what your game will be and who it will be for. With that in hand you will gather information from available sources to effectively simulate or hypothesize how your game will do.

What we have described here is a Historical Market Research approach and this is most common for indies due to a lack of other affordable options.\

If you have the budget you should select a marketing partner studio who can help you perform more "intelligent" market research. You may be surprised at just how "indie friendly" marketing partners can be if you do a bit digging. As an added bonus having a marketing partner and a budget to fuel them with can significantly boost project viability.

Your first requirement of course is to find a source of information.

Their are plenty of resources available some free, some paid. VGI as linked above is a paid option and one we have used on several projects and is useful for PC games deploying on Steam.

Steam Spy is another option for Steam and has a free option.

Once you have a source you need to identify similar projects to yours in that source and understand the audience they hit and how well. It can be useful to take a look at the other projects that are not similar to yours but that hit the same sorts of audience targets.

Your goal here is to try and abstract out a "typical customer" or more commonly several that represent your "target audiences".

Early in design it can also be useful to abstract out the "typical game" relevant for your project. This could be variations similar to what you have in mind and or variations of games that overlap with your target audiences.

With the "Typical Customers" and or "Typical Games" in hand you pull hypothetical numbers from your sources to give a feel for the "best case", "worst case" and "most probable". This may also help you adjust any areas of your design that where more \[ shrug emoji ] up to this point.
