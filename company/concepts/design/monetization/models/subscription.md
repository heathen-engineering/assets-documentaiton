Subscription has become quite popular among publishers and services and is quickly becoming hated by consumers of all types. The model is simple enough, you offer a "subscription" that is a recurring charge to the player that grants them access and or other perks.

Originally subscription based games required the subscription in order to play though more modern subscription based games are really a hybrid of Free to Play (F2P) and Subscription. The subscription model in game really got its start with the Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) genre however a true subscription only model was pretty quickly replaced with alternatives.
