Bundles are tool that allow you to "bundle" up multiple items and apply a discount making it more attractive to purchase the bundle than each item independently.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Obviously this can be made annoying if your packing bundles full of junk no one wants and 1 item everyone wants but cant get else where.\
\
One option to avoid this annoyance is to offer each for sale on its own "ala carte" as well as in a bundle. Be sure to use a Steam style dynamic bundle that can adjust its price based on the items the user already owns or you will fall into another annoying problem ... I already own some of this but not all of it ... is it still a good deal?\
\
Steam's Dynamic bundles will remove already owned items and reduce the price for the user. Other platforms typically have a similar "catch up bundle" concepts.

Bundles can take many forms. the most common is simply as a bundle, you have no doubt seen these on Steam such as a publishers bundle or franchise bundle. follows are a few types of bundles and notes on how they are implemented.

This is a bundle the user purchases typically before the contents are released and are marketed as things such as "Seasons Pass" or "Pre-order bundle". They typically contain 2 or more expansions, chapters, episodes or other digital content for some discounted price.

### Content Bundles

These can be displayed or called a number of things ... even loot boxes. What separates this from Surprise Mechanics (predatory loot boxes) is knowing exactly what is in side and it being available as a regular product e.g. not time limited or "FOMO" based

### Game Bundles

Games are digital items to, bundling multiple games together can encourage players to try new things by lowering the barrier to entry ... that is offering a discount. Game bundles might be themed such as "Publisher Bundle", "Franchise Bundle", etc. or may simply be a collection of games that agreed to be part of a bundle ... e.g. Humble Bundle style.
