## Introduction

Easily abused use with caution\
see [Play to Earn](../models/play-to-earn.md)

The idea is simply that you allow your players to sale and buy items to and from each other with real currency ... taking a cut. Tools like Steam's Community Marketplace are an example of this.

The issues with a community marketplace are similar or depending on the implementation the same as with Play to Earn. While it may not be your intent its very easy for these community marketplaces to turn into harmful or even illicit systems. Take a look at the history of Steam's Community Marketplace to see a few examples of the rather major problems that can happen.

## Anti grey market

So one use or rather justification for introducing or permitting a community marketplace is to counter grey markets. Grey markets are where players outside your control buy and sale in-game goods. These markets are problematic as they are not managed or regulated in anyway so theft and cons run rampant.

The issue is the same as with the "anti gold farming" argument of premium currency. Your solving 1 problem by creating another. Community marketplaces can be ran and managed safely but they are not a solution to a grey market problem.
