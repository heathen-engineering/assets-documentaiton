These are simply examples of real world games that are successful that are absolutely doing it wrong. The issue isn't that they are not profitable ... all of these titles are highly profitable. The issue is that these titles are predatory and are attracting additional regulation to the industry via wanton harm to the public at large.

You do not want to be "why" a thing is made illegal, you want to be the one who knew it was wrong before a regulator told you so.

The titles listed here are listed in no particular order and are simply a sample of main stream successful titles that are predatory.
