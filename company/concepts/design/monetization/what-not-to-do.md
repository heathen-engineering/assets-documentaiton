These are simply examples of real world games that are successful financially and that are absolutely doing it wrong. The issue isn't that they are not profitable ... all of these titles are highly profitable. The issue is that these titles are predatory and are attracting additional regulation to the industry via wanton harm to the public at large.

> You do not want to be part of "why" a thing is made illegal, you want to be one of those who knew it was wrong before a regulator told you so.

The titles listed here are listed in no particular order and are simply a sample of main stream successful titles that are predatory.
