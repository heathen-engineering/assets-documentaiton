## Introduction

The following are major areas of consideration you should seriously think about before doing anything.

{% hint style="success" %}
Read over every entry here but don't panic yet.



Their are indie friendly ways to account for every aspect of this journey, its not free, its not easy but it is absolutely worth it if this is your passion.
{% endhint %}

## Registration and Administration

In many regions you are legally required to register a business, yes even if its just you. In most cases its strongly advised that you incorporate and not simply "DBA" (doing business as). The specifics of this are highly dependent on region, deal with legal matters and are not appropriately advised on via a community forum or even this article.&#x20;

Go see a professional that deals with Company Formation in your region and understand what your obligations are as well as to seek advise on what options might best work for you. Finding a local advisor or partner to help you here is key. Most regions will have state/government ran programs and initiatives meant to support new businesses, this is particularly common with new arts, technical and consequently game businesses.

### Accounting

If your going to be buying anything or making any money then you need an accountant. You will always need an accountant so rather you staff this or partner, this will be a permanent relationship for you and your company. Its worth noting that many accounting firms also handle company registration and can advise on administration aspects. This is also highly specific to each region and deals with legal matters so taking the advise of some community forum or even this article is insufficient ... seek a local professional for advise.

### Legal

As a game developer even before you have a game ready to publish you will be creating and using other peoples creations. Making sure your complying with any legal requirements and registering any IP, names, marks, etc. as is required by your local regulations is critical and often overlooked. This is usually something that you Registration and Administration and or Accounting partner may handle ... that is you can usually find a partner that is suitable to advise and guide on all three of these aspects.

## Production

### Design

Seems obvious right?\
This is usually the one common thing we all (game developers) do or are interested in. That however doesn't mean we are all game designers and that we have a passion for it as our core skill. If your not the game designer you need to source for this fundamental requirement. Staffing up usually the preference here but it is possible to contract or even outsource your game design.

### Engineering

{% hint style="danger" %}
No you cannot create a professional fully featured game without dealing with engineering. I don't care what XXXX tool says on the box that is not reality.\


Engineering is not typing words into a compiler to "make computer go". \
\
The act of analysing requirements, designing, building, testing and integrating tools and systems to resolve those requirements.\
\
That is engineering ... or at least the main part of it you need an engineer for.
{% endhint %}

Visual scripting tools, blueprints, "code free" development tools ... they can all help your prototype but they are not a replacement for an engineer. Even if your project never requires a single line of code to be typed out you will still require engineering as a skill to complete your project.

### Visual Art

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to release a professional game you cannot be releasing it with Unity Asset Store artwork in it. \
\
Art assets on the Unity Asset Store and similar marketplaces are wonderful placeholders, inspiration pieces or even as a base or bash kit to work from when creating custom works. UAS Art Assets however are not production ready regardless of what is said on the store page. You might get away with it as a passion project done by a hobbyist but the moment you put that professional hat on and try to be a business your clients and probably some of your peers are going to rip you apart.
{% endhint %}

Visual Art (usually just called art but audio guys get offended :wink:)&#x20;

Rather its for your UI, world design, characters, VFX ... just like Engineering is more than "type words make computer go", visual art is a lot more than 2D images and 3D models. Sourcing a solution to create your visual design style and then producing the content in that style to meet your projects requirements is an obvious requirement for any game project.

### Testing

{% hint style="warning" %}
No community testing and public beta are not even close to sufficient.



This is one of the factors that separates the hobbyist game from the professional game. Nothing wrong with being the passion project of a talented hobbyist but a professional game is held to a stricter standard.
{% endhint %}

If you outsourced your engineering that firm probably also provides for testing, if your handling engineering needs in house then your going to need to solve for testing as well. Testing is one of those areas that really only works at scale ... that is to say it requires a larger entity to do well consequently small studios even ones specialized in engineering will outsource some or all of there testing. Even "testing studios" who are the ones often contracted to be that outsourced testing solution are typically leaning very heavily on contractors to meet the demand.
