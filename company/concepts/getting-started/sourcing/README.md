Most developers are small studio or even teams of one and lack the resource in house to meet all the need of designing, developing, testing, deploying and operating a game as a commercial product. Staffing up is an option if you have the budget but not always the best route. Keeping your studio focused and agile means keeping your headcount down. The moral question of staffing up for subsequent layoff is another area that doesn't sit well with many not to mention the "Gold Crutch" that typically causes.

Their are a lot of hidden aspects to game development, and really running any business. Creating a game (as in the .exe you run and play) is a very small part of the process of creating a game (as in the product).

### The Solution

Selecting partners to "Gap Fill" and help you deliver on your ambitions while you focus on what is most important to your team. Contracting and outsourcing are nothing new and is not a silver bullet that will solve all your issues. It is however a valid and valuable option when deployed correctly, for indie developers in particular it is a key strategy.

The idea is simple in concept, identify the aspects of the project that you will keep in house. These are the aspects of your business and your project that you have the time, skill and desire to handle personally. For all other aspects you must source a solution, staff up, contract freelancers or select a partner.

Of course in practice its not as simple as option A), B) or C) and in this section we will highlight key aeras of consideration as well as tools and examples that may help you along the way.
