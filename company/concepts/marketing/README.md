## Introduction

Its fair to say that most indie games fail due to marketing and in most every case when they succeed its in no small part thanks to marketing (and good [Community Management](../community/)).&#x20;

That isn't to say that you can throw everything behind a good marketing strategy and short change the game ... that has worked for some before but we do not condone that behaviour nor is it likely to work for most indies as really who has that kind of budget.

Marketing is however, as much as we may not want to admit it, an absolutely critical component and one virtually every small shop to include Heathen often forgets about.&#x20;

This section will approach marketing as an indie, solo or small studio. We will look at the "low hanging fruit" anyone can exploit as well as your options for further investment in your projects marketing efforts.
