## Introduction

A simple to-do-list every business should should consider in this industry.

## Partner

Marketing is one of those things that requires scale, that is marketing is most effective at volume. Consequently marketing is not something you can do to a professional level as a side hustle or of many hats your waring.

> But I am the Designer, Writer, Artist, Programmer, Tester, Community Manager, Executive Officer, ....

And if you want to make a business of this then you need to start doing as many of those things at a professional level as you can. This means 1 person cannot do everything, not and compete.

Selecting a marketing partner is the best option for most small studios and especially for solo developers. A proper marketing partner will function as an extension of your studio and is capable of being your fully outsourced marketing division complete with strategy planning, market research, ad content production, ad campaign execution, market performance analysis, product positioning and much much more.&#x20;

We have a whole guide section dedicated to [Steam ](../steam/)you can find it [here](../steam/).

## Market Research

[Read more here](market-research.md).

Simply put market research is the researching or gathering of information about your target customer's needs, preferences and expectations. You probably know this term as a feature of marketing and that is true, marketing teams will perform market research to understand a products position in a given market.

Market research is used for more than marketing and should be taken into account when developing and refining your game design.&#x20;
