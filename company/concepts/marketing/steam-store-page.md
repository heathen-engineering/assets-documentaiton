Steam has around 44,000 game developers that publish on it, before you panic and run for the hills understand that about 60% of those aren't really trying to compete. Steam has a vibrant community of student devs, hobbyist and passion projects. Another 35% give or take or about 15,000 developers fill out the typical first time indie or solo dev bracket with the last 5% or so being small but established studios and big players.

( figures are revenue per title for life of title )

* approximately 25k developers or 57% of developers\
  < 1k revenue
* approximately 9k developers or 20% of developers\
  1k to 10k revenue
* approximately 6k developers or 13% of developers\

* approximately 3k developers or 7% of developers\
  100k to 1m revenue

This is useful for understanding what sorts of projects are on Steam, how many and what that distribution looks like.&#x20;
