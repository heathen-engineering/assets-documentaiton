# Monetization

## Overview

Predatory monetization practices have been incredibly harmful to our industry.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The calculation is quite simple;\
Is it possible for a person to spend an infinite or even simply unreasonable amount on your product?\
\
if you answered yes then your product is predatory and is whaling by definition, you are part of the problem.
{% endhint %}

While harm to the consumer should clearly be considered harmful to our industry if you are able to somehow justify that consider this.&#x20;

> Predatory practices and harm to the general public have and will continue to bring regulation and oversight.

Additional regulation and oversight brings complexity, legal exposer and in general reduces the opportunities and general efficiency of the industry. By choosing to shit the bed you are insuring this industry will grow less, experience higher overhead and be less resistant to future obstacles.

This article will assume you do not actively want to cause harm to others, your self or the industry. Here we will explore various monetization options, the impact they have on the user, your game and your bottom line. The intent is to help you develop a fair, honest and ethical monetization schema that can deliver you success.

### More reasons to not suck

While their are plenty who will monetize even in a predatory system and of course a handful of whales can sustain you at least until the lawsuits role in there are more reasons to not suck.

Introducing MTX of any kind will always bring a portion of the player base that flames/trolls with the classic "Pay 2 Win", "Cash Grab", etc. etc. line. The more we see actual pay to win and cash grabs coupled up with increasing reports of little Johnny emptying his mommy's bank account the more your image will tarnish. A simple risk assessment should show you that other options yield similar or even greater potential for profit and lack the stigma and potential regulatory and legal issues.
