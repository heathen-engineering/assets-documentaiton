# Monetization

## Overview

Predatory monetization practices have been incredibly harmful to our industry.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The calculation is quite simple;\
Is it possible for a person to spend an infinite or even simply unreasonable amount on your product?\
\
if you answered yes then your product is predatory and is whaling by definition, you are part of the problem.
{% endhint %}

While harm to the consumer should clearly be considered harmful to our industry if you are able to somehow justify that consider this.&#x20;

> Predatory practices and harm to the general public have and will continue to bring regulation and oversight.

Additional regulation and oversight brings complexity, legal exposer and in general reduces the opportunities and general efficiency of the industry. By choosing to shit the bed you are insuring this industry will grow less, experience higher overhead and be less resistant to future obstacles.

This article will assume you do not actively want to cause harm to others, your self or the industry. Here we will explore various monetization options, the impact they have on the user, your game and your bottom line. The intent is to help you develop a fair, honest and ethical monetization schema that can deliver you success.

### More reasons to not suck

While their are plenty who will monetize even in a predatory system and of course a handful of whales can sustain you at least until the lawsuits role in there are more reasons to not suck.

Introducing MTX of any kind will always bring a portion of the player base that flames/trolls with the classic "Pay 2 Win", "Cash Grab", etc. etc. line. The more we see actual pay to win and cash grabs coupled up with increasing reports of little Johnny emptying his mommy's bank account the more your image will tarnish. A simple risk assessment should show you that other options yield similar or even greater potential for profit and lack the stigma and potential regulatory and legal issues.

## Tools

Coming soon

This section will outline systems, tools and patterns such as currencies, loot boxes, player markets and so on and wont bother with rather its good or bad.

## Bad Options

This section goes over some concepts that are just fundamentally harmful to your game and the industry and talks about why that is the case.

### Play to Earn

This is one of the most problematic we have seen to date.&#x20;

#### Definition:

In this model a player "buys in" in some manner rather that is the purchase of some content or out right a buy in via a NFT or in game currency. That "buy in" is risked through gameplay that may result in a reward or "earning". That is the player can "play to earn", another way to word it is … the player can "wager an ante in a game for a chance of winning a pot".

Is it not clear how this is 100% gambling. Its literally the definition of poker and every other betting game.

#### Why it sucks:

Obvious reason 1

Put very bluntly a "Play to Earn" accordingly to the definitions and regulations in many regions is clearly gambling. We here at Heathen are not pearl clutching "Gambling is bad M-kay" in fact a couple of us have worked in that industry creating gambling games. However, if you want to create a gambling product you must follow the regulations associated with gambling. Attempting to hide gambling within a video game is going to result in huge issues for you and more damage to the industry.

Obvious reason 2

Its at best a pyramid scheme like feature. If this isn't outright illegal in your region yet, it likely will be soon. Even then it is defiantly harmful to your players and over time will result in a very nasty collapse. \
\
Well maybe you came up with someway this isn't a closed echo-system pyramid scheme! Willing to bet you just came up with a layered pyramid scheme but lets assume you did. You still have the fundamental issue of associating "real" value with a game system. When "real" value becomes involved the legal risk and exposure you face goes up, and the effect of your game as an entertainment medium is changed. At best a "game" with real value is gambling, at worst its work, in both cases every major nation regulates that tightly.

Obvious reason 3

Lets assume you live in the wild wild west and legal and regulator issues are not a problem. Lets also assume your player base are all well balanced people with no control issues at all. Both impossible fictions but still.

Assuming you are here to learn how to monetize a piece of creative entertainment work, allowing "real value" to creep into your game world is the fastest way to "kill the fun".&#x20;

Now of course gambling games can be said to be fun, that is a since of thrill seeking based on wagering and actually doesn't have as much to do with winning as some think.

The type of fun we refer to in "pure" entertainment sources such as story telling, books, music, movies and video games is quite different. What was once a fun thing one \*wanted\* to do simply to do it ... is now a thing they must do to earn. At best you made your game a job, for most those you made your game a source of further depression.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The idea of turning a "game" into "work" happens not just with "Play to Earn" but is also seen with games that reward for every action. When a player is "working" for the next reward they are not "playing" the game they are simply exploiting it as they would an employer for the next payoff.\
\
Play to Eran simply dials this effect on up to 11 of out 10.
{% endhint %}

### Gacha

Until we saw Play to Earn this was the worst offender. Why is it not as bad as Play to Earn ... well in this model there is at least the guise of play covering up the ante step of betting.

#### Definition & why it sucks

In short its a slot machine. This comes in a few flavours described below … they are all horrible practices designed to prey on the consumer in basically the same way.

This model revolves around not allowing the player to simply buy what they want but forcing them to engage in a game of chance to get what they want e.g. randomized loot box, card draw, etc.

Complete Gacha

Players attempt to complete a set of common items at random in a particular loot pool in order to combine them into a rarer item. The first few items in a set can be rapidly acquired but as the number of missing items decreases it becomes increasingly unlikely the player can complete the set. This is particularly true if there are a large number of common items in the game.

This was found to be illegal by Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency in 2012

Box Gacha

Basically a way to hide the true price of something, the randomized loot pool is restricted and each pull reduces the items until every item is owned. So this lets the user think ... ah that skin is 99c ... course there are 100 items in the loot pool so worst case its 100$ best case its 99c ... in a fair system its 50$ given weighting which most do its probably more like 10 or 20 the first time you monetize and 60 or 70 times there after.

Redraw Gacha

Randomized loot whcih can be re-rolled in hopes of a better result. This is akin to the "Free Spin" you see in US style slot machines. Its not usually really free but is a away to keep the monkey ... I mean player playing.

Trade Gacha

aka dup currency. That is you can trade unwanted items for a currency that either lets you buy things outright or get more tries at what you want.

Consecutive Gacha

aka batch gacha, this is those bundles you see ... 1.00 for 10 crystals ... 10.00 for 130 crystals 30% savings! So a means to get you to spend more in bulk ... its diabolical saves on transaction fees and gets more money out of the suckers ... I mean gamers.

Step-up Gacha

Or high-roller or whaling gacha. This model increases the chances of the more rare items with each roll. Thus people who can spend more will as it gives a since of increasing the stakes. Again US slot machines do this to in the "jackpot" systems.

Discount Gacha

In short use sales / discounts to make your over priced RNG boxes seem like a better deal.

### FOMO

This stands for "Fear of Missing Out" and is a marketing tool ... so you know its wrong from the start:joy:

The most common example of FOMO in games are Seasons and the Seasons Pass is a prime example of a FOMO based monetization scheme. As are lightening deals or anything else that drives a consumer to monetize based on the fear of missing some opportunity.&#x20;

This is often managed through some form of artificial scarcity or other limit that rases the urgency in monetizing now.

### Premium Currency

#### Definition:

A currency in-game that can only be acquired through a cash shop

#### Why it sucks

This touches on a few issues.

* Introduces "real value" into the game
* Introduces limitless spending into the game
* hides the actual cost of purchases
* often built to encourage excessive spending e.g. what you want costs 1250, you can buy 200, 500 or 1000 … what do you do?

## Good Options

Coming soon

This is a set of "good" examples meaning monetization systems that are not predatory. Doesn't mean your gamers will like or that they will suit just any game. Items in this list are simply considered non-predatory.
