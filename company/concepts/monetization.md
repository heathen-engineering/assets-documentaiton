## Overview

You will find wording and terminology here that calls out bad practices as the bad practices they are. This is meant to help inform you not offend you however we make not apologies for any offence either.

## Anti-Whaling

Predatory monetization practices have been incredibly harmful to our industry.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The calculation is quite simple;\
Is it possible for a person to spend an infinite or even simply unreasonable amount on your product?\
\
if you answered yes then your product is predatory and is whaling by definition, you are part of the problem.
{% endhint %}

While harm to the consumer should clearly be considered harmful to our industry if you are able to somehow justify that consider this.&#x20;

> Predatory practices and harm to the general public have and will continue to bring regulation and oversight.

Additional regulation and oversight brings complexity, legal exposer and in general reduces the opportunities and general efficiency of the industry. By choosing to shit the bed you are insuring this industry will grow less, experience higher overhead and be less resistant to future obstacles.

This article will assume you do not actively want to cause harm to others, your self or the industry. Here we will explore various monetization options, the impact they have on the user, your game and your bottom line. The intent is to help you develop a fair, honest and ethical monetization schema that can deliver you success.

### Morality

A typical argument is that the player is not forced to participate in the game at all much less in its monetization scheme ... by this same logic Ponzi schemes should be legal. Attempting to justify whaling or other predatory practices via the justification that some users can afford and do want it is the "High roller" argument. A High roller is a term from the gaming industry (gambling) and refers to a person that plays at higher than normal stakes. Games designed for high rollers are absolutely legitimate forms of entertainment, in the gaming industry where regulations and oversight are in place to insure fair terms and mitigate harm to the wider public.

The issue with predatory monetization practices is that they have an unacceptably high chance of causing harm to vulnerable persons. What defines "unacceptably high chance" should be clear as a normal functioning human being where its not your regulatory boards will inform you all be it to late in most cases. In general you should make every effort to protect vulnerable persons. The simplest way to do so is simply to keep it to morally tenable forms of monetization. If its not clear what that is, up front and clear pricing, with a max spend that is clearly identified and reasonable for the product delivered.

### More reasons to not suck

While their are plenty who will monetize even in a predatory system and of course a handful of whales can sustain you at least until the lawsuits role in there are more reasons to not suck.

Introducing MTX of any kind will always bring a portion of the player base that flames/trolls with the classic "Pay 2 Win", "Cash Grab", etc. etc. line. The more we see actual pay to win and cash grabs coupled up with increasing reports of little Johnny emptying his mommy's bank account the more your image will tarnish. A simple risk assessment should show you that other options yield similar or even greater potential for profit and lack the stigma and potential regulatory and legal issues.

### But this is how its done in mobile

Because a bad behaviour has been tolerated to date doesn't mean it should continue to be. Frankly there has been little to no respect or care for mobile since its inception. This allowed truly horrible practices to develop unchecked though that is changing. These practices have been drawing increasingly negative attention of government regulation over the past 20 years and that will continue to accelerate.&#x20;

You should simply avoid these practices because they are harmful to the public. If you are incapable of that level of humanity then understand that participating in these practices will only serve to accelerate harsh regulation and is likely to render your product increasingly unfit for distribution in larger and larger markets. The time of predatory monetization isn't quite over but its end is coming and it will bring plenty down with it. Don't get caught up in that, find fair and balanced solutions to monetize your product.
