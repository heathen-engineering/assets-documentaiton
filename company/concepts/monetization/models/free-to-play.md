# Free to Play

Free to play (F2P) struggled when it was first introduced and still does to some extent due to a common misunderstanding.

If a game is "Free to Play" that doesn't mean the game is "Free" …&#x20;

It means that the entry point, that is getting started with the game is free-ish. Rather this is done by capping progress, slowing progress, restricting access to content or some other system or limitation. Creating games costs money and thus playing them does to.

Early players jumped into these F2P games thinking they where "Free" games. That is a game that puts zero cost on the consumer. Free games do exist and where becoming more popular at the time likely adding to the confusion.

{% hint style="info" %}
Free games still are not free, they simply don't monetize the gamer, they monetize the advertiser or some other external party or are them selves an advertisement for some non-free product or service.\

Nothing is free
{% endhint %}

The main attraction to this model for most indie devs is that "zero barrier to entry" that is any player at any time can try your game out risk free. For an indie reducing that initial risk or "barrier to entry" is an attractive way to grow your player base.

### Stigma

F2P still has a stigma especially for games that introduce this model after go live. The general notion is that a F2P game is cheap, cash grab, predatory, etc.. A lot of good work has been done to show that F2P games can be legitimate, non-predatory quality experiences, they are however still the minority and the stigma still exists.&#x20;
