# Pay to Play

The original form of monetization.

Its hard to beat this one, user pays you money, you provide a product as agreed, user players said product.

Really this is the golden ideal for consumers, so why does everything else exist?

Pay to play (P2P) simply means you have an up-front, one time defined price that people pay â€¦ in order to play your game. P2P's main issue is that its not sustainable. There are often arguments on this but the maths for most studios are such that any project over a certain level of ambition just aren't viable for a 1 time price.

## The Factors

These are factors of the cost of building a game that can be useful to think about as levers you can adjust to adjust the cost and thus profit of a game.

### Team Size

Keep the team small.\
A smaller team has less overhead but there are more benefits as well. Smaller teams are more efficient and there is increasing evidence that small focused organizations working together yield better result at a lower cost than fewer larger organizations. Whatever approach you take consider keeping your team small, when and where you require look to partners specialized in those gap areas you have and compare that to the cost of staffing up and then letting that staff go when your done with them.

### Scope

You have likely heard this a lot, you probably think you have scaled your ambitions back a lot already. Never the less you probably have a bigger game in mind that is reasonable for your team and budget.&#x20;

### Monetization

The core issue with Pay to Play, lack of flexibility. Some studios are looking to raise the accepted price of a game while also looking into hybrid models. The issue here is the way this is being approached is very hostile toward consumers.&#x20;

## Examples

Every game that has a price tag at the register. Most games in the modern age are a hybrid of P2P and various F2P features such as an upfront price tag, seasons, microtransaction and DLC.

### True Pay 2 Play

{% hint style="warning" %}
A few games attempt to stand on a soap box and say Pay 2 Play and nothing else ... most reverse that within a year or so noting that player exception of on going support and maintenance requires additional revenue.\
\
The days of releasing a game and being done with it have been dead and gone for decades at this point. Your game will incur maintenance costs post launch to some degree.
