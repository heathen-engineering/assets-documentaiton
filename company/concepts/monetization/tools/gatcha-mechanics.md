# Gatcha Mechanics

### Gacha

Until we saw Play to Earn this was the worst offender. Why is it not as bad as Play to Earn ... well in this model there is at least the guise of play covering up the ante step of betting.

#### Definition & why it sucks

In short its a slot machine. This comes in a few flavours described below â€¦ they are all horrible practices designed to prey on the consumer in basically the same way.

This model revolves around not allowing the player to simply buy what they want but forcing them to engage in a game of chance to get what they want e.g. randomized loot box, card draw, etc.

Complete Gacha

Players attempt to complete a set of common items at random in a particular loot pool in order to combine them into a rarer item. The first few items in a set can be rapidly acquired but as the number of missing items decreases it becomes increasingly unlikely the player can complete the set. This is particularly true if there are a large number of common items in the game.

This was found to be illegal by Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency in 2012

Box Gacha

Basically a way to hide the true price of something, the randomized loot pool is restricted and each pull reduces the items until every item is owned. So this lets the user think ... ah that skin is 99c ... course there are 100 items in the loot pool so worst case its 100$ best case its 99c ... in a fair system its 50$ given weighting which most do its probably more like 10 or 20 the first time you monetize and 60 or 70 times there after.

Redraw Gacha

Randomized loot whcih can be re-rolled in hopes of a better result. This is akin to the "Free Spin" you see in US style slot machines. Its not usually really free but is a away to keep the monkey ... I mean player playing.

Trade Gacha

aka dup currency. That is you can trade unwanted items for a currency that either lets you buy things outright or get more tries at what you want.

Consecutive Gacha

aka batch gacha, this is those bundles you see ... 1.00 for 10 crystals ... 10.00 for 130 crystals 30% savings! So a means to get you to spend more in bulk ... its diabolical saves on transaction fees and gets more money out of the suckers ... I mean gamers.

Step-up Gacha

Or high-roller or whaling gacha. This model increases the chances of the more rare items with each roll. Thus people who can spend more will as it gives a since of increasing the stakes. Again US slot machines do this to in the "jackpot" systems.

Discount Gacha

In short use sales / discounts to make your over priced RNG boxes seem like a better deal.
