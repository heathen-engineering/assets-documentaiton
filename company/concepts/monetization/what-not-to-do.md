# What not to do

{% hint style="info" %}
Loot boxes are the most common predatory problem and many games are starting to remove them as regulations start to tighten. We will seek to update this list regularly and annotate why a game is on the list.\
\
The purpose of this list is so you can see a real world example of "doing it wrong"  this is not an exhaustive list obviously simply high profile and or successful titles that you should not seek to emulate.
{% endhint %}

## Overview

These are simply examples of real world games that are successful that are absolutely doing it wrong. The issue isn't that they are not profitable ... all of these titles are highly profitable. The issue is that these titles are predatory and are attracting additional regulation to the industry via wanton harm to the public at large.

You do not want to be "why" a thing is made illegal, you want to be the one who knew it was wrong before a regulator told you so.

The titles listed here is listed in no particular order.
