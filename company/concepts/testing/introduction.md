## Introduction

Do not overlook the critical importance of having a formalized testing process in place. Software testing is a complex topic and it is separate to the design and development skill and thus shouldn't be created or performed by the same staff.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you designed it or developed it then you cannot adequately test it.

These sections will introduce you to software and game testing concepts and practices to help you deliver a quality product. This is not a topic anyone can afford to cut corners on and is a part of your project that will have time and money costs if you plan on doing it properly.

## Terminology

This is a quick and dirty break down of some of the terms we will use in this article. You may have heard other terms and or different definitions ... that's fine. This is here so you can understand what we mean when we say these things.

### QA (quality assurance)

Process oriented approach meant to assure quality

Quality assurance (QA) is the defined practices and processes that govern work from start to finish. In short its the systematic approach you take in the execution of your work to "assure" a given level of "quality". As you might imagine QA is not limited to the testing of your game/app but rather should be a wholistic practice covering the whole company and defining the project its self. We define it here as QA dictates the QC approach you will be using.

### QC (quality control)

Product oriented approach meant to identify quality

Quality control (QC) is what we are focused on in this section. Its the practices, processes and tools used to identify the quality level of the product in question. To grossly over simplify; test game and see if its good enough.

### Test

This is a defined process that when executed defines the quality of some unit, function, system or other finite part of the product. A proper test will describe every aspect of the testing process and the expected results for each step. Typically a test is a multi-step process with each step having defined requirements, inputs and expected outputs. You can learn more in the [Writing Test](writing-tests.md) article.
