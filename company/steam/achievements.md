## Introduction

Achievements are a simple and traditional feature for games that can help drive player engagement. While they are simple to implement (make work) coming up with a good achievement design is not so simple. You could of course :face\_vomiting: forth random achievements like "Played 15 min", "Logged into the game", "Pressed the space bar"; but these are often time harmful to the game not helpful.

First understand that not every game needs achievements, that if your going to have achievements that they should be part of the game and not an after thought you bolted on because why not. Meaningless achievements can harm the user experience by breaking immersion or simply drawing attention away during gameplay.

Follows are some ideas for meaningful achievements and how you might tie those achievements into other aspects of your game.

## New Player Experience

Think of your achievements like a meta quest ...&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Meta means beyond or above, etc. and when we use it we mean a concept, information, etc. that is not part of the main but additional and external to it.
{% endhint %}

Like a meta quest, that is a quest for the player (not the character in game world) to learn your game. To encourage them to explore the features and functions of your game in a structured manner and to offer some non-gameplay impacting reward for doing so.

For a practical example of this see DOTA 2's "New Player Experience" aka "Welcome Quests" where they present "quests" for new players to do simple things like open menus, use features, review information, play each of the game modes, etc. Importantly this is not hidden from the player its presented to the player in the menu's just like a quest, showing what steps are yet to be done and which have been done.

## Tutorial

The best tutorials fun and engaging parts of the game that happen to also teach the player mechanics, concepts, demonstrate tactics and strategies and more. Similar to the New Player Experience approach you can use Achievements as a means to draw attention to these instructions and reward their completion without forcing the player into them.

## Item Rewards

Steam Inventory is a huge topic unto its self that needs its own guide. The overlay with Achievements is that you can restrict eligibility for Item Promotion drops based on unlocked achievements. You can use this with New Player Experience or Tutorial style achievements to award in-game items for completing the tasks.

## Collectors

There are many types of players and a common one across all game genres is the "Collector" this is a type of player that likes to "100%" the game. Be carful to not bloat your game with meaningless achievements as this will simply frustrate the collector but do make sure to track and reward them for fully exploring your game.
