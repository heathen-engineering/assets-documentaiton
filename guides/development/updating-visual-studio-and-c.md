# ðŸ”¼ Updating Visual Studio and C\#

## Introduction

Unity Installer does a pore job of updating Visual Studio and the .NET Framework so there will be occasions when you need to do this yourself if you work with Unity for any period of time.

Visual Studio and .NET like any bit of software or framework do require the occasional update. If you have ever seen an error such as.

> out variable declaration cannot be used because it is not part of the C# #.# language specification

or&#x20;

> Tuple must contain at least two elements

or

> A new expression requires (),\[] or...

Then the issue you have is you are on an older specification of C# and missing language features.

## Visual Studio Installer

The easiest way to update is within Visual Studio itself. In many cases, you will see a yellow banner or flag in the upper right corner of the Visual Studio app you can click it and download and install updates.

If the flag is not present or you prefer another method you can press open the Start Menu on Windows and type Visual Studio Installer

In general, we recommend you keep your Visual Studio IDE up to date with the latest option available.
