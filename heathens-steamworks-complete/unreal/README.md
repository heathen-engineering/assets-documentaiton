### But Online Subsystem Steam?

{% hint style="success" %}
Heathen's Steamworks Complete will save you hundreds if not thousands of hours and enable you to exploit every feature Valve's Steamworks provides easily, efficiently and in a stable and robust manner.
{% endhint %}

[Online Subsystem Steam](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/online-subsystem-steam-interface-in-unreal-engine/) is a barebones integration of the basics. Setting aside the poor documentation it also simply lacks many of Valve's most valuable Steamworks features and what is covered is only partially covered.

Heathen's Steamworks Complete is as its name suggests a complete solution, more than "Just Another Steam API Wrapper" we go further, Heathen's Steamworks Complete exposes the whole of Steamworks as Blueprint functions and bindable events. We deliver ready-to-use widgets and blueprints for common use cases and editor tools like the Steam Build Tool.

Beyond the engine plugin, we also provide an extensive knowledge base that goes beyond simply listing interfaces and provides actual guidance for not just technical features but every aspect of the Steam platform. We also foster a rich community of thousands of game developers that have shipped hundreds of games on Steam and of course, we provide support for our asset and your use of it.

### Steamworks Complete Plugin

{% hint style="info" %}
We are in the process of migrating Steamworks Complete to Unreal at times the documentation may be ahead of the plugin or behind a bit ... for any questions see our [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/463483739612381204/1153799474620137483).

* Full native Steamworks SDK for both C++ and Blueprints\
  Unlike Unreal's existing solutions `Steam Core` and `Online Subsystem Steam`, Heathen's Steamworks Complete is the full Steamworks SDK, every feature, every endpoint, and every callback.
* Battle-tested systems\
  10+ years developing for Steam supporting thousands of developers shipping hundreds of games. Heathen's Steamworks Complete is much more than just another Steam wrapper. We handle the boilerplate for you, we provide game-ready systems for common use cases, and we enable you to Do More!
* Rich Knowledge Base\
  Steam API is known for its ... sparse ... documentation. Heathen steps in and delivers more than lists of functions and members. We have guides, tips, tricks, best practices and more not just for our own tools but Steam as a platform and game development in general. We are your go-to resource.
* Live Community / Support\
  Join a community of fellow developers working across multiple engines. We provide live support and real-time conversation supporting not just our own tools but fostering a helpful and supportive community around Steam and game development in general.
