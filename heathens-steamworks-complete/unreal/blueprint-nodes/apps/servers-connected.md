# ðŸ”» Servers Connected

## Introduction

Called when a connection to the Steam back-end has been established. This means the Steam client now has a working connection to the Steam servers. Usually, this will have occurred before the game has launched, and should only be seen if the user has dropped connection due to a networking issue or a Steam server update.
