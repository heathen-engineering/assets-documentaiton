## Introduction

Steam error result codes.

These are frequently returned by functions, callbacks, and call results from both the Steamworks API and the Web API. An API may return arbitrary EResult codes, refer to the documentation for that API function or callback to see what it could return and what they mean in the context of that API call. This is similar to Win32's HRESULT type or POSIXs errno.

Heathen's UEResult is a blueprint-friendly wrapper around this common enum
