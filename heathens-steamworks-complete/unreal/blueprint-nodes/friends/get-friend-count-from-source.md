## Introduction

Get friends from a given source such as a Steam Group, Chat Room, Lobby or Game Server. This makes use of two nodes `Get Friend Count From Source` which determines the number of friends relevant to that source and `Get Friend from Source by Index` which returns the ID of a friend given its index.

Alternatively, we have created a simpler Get Friend From Source node that will populate an array with the friend IDs you can store these or iterate over them using standard tools such as For Each Loop.
