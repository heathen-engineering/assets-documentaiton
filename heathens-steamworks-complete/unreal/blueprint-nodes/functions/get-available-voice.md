## Introduction

Checks to see if there is captured audio data available from [Get Voice](get-voice.md), and gets the size of the data.\
\
Most applications will only use compressed data and should ignore the other parameters, which exist primarily for backwards compatibility. See [Get Voice](get-voice.md) for further explanation of "uncompressed" data.

### Return Value

A [Voice Available Result](../types/voice-available-result.md) object expressing the state of the system and the amount of data available to be read
