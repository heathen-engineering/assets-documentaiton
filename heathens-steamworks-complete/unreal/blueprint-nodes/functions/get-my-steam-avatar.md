## Introduction

Loads the local user's Steam Avatar image into a Unreal Texture 2D and invokes an event when completed.

## Nodes

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This node uses a callback delegate which will be invoked when the process is completed and which will contain the Texsture2D result.
