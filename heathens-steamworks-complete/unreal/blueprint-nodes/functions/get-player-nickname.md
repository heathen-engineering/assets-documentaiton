## Introduction

Gets the nickname that the current user has set for the specified user.

### Id (input)

The ID of the user to get the nickname for.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The local user will never have a nickname.&#x20;

A nickname is the name the local user has assigned another user.&#x20;

For example let's assume your brother is your friend on Steam, and his chosen Steam Name is BroForce92, you could give him the nickname Little Bro; for you and only you the Get Player Nickname would return Little Bro for his user.&#x20;

You don't nickname yourself, when you set your name that is you setting your persona name.
{% endhint %}

### Return Value

**NULL** if no nickname has been set for that user.
