## Introduction

Several options are available for reading a stat value for the local user, a specific user, for the user's value, the global value of the stat or the historical value of an averaged stat.

### API Name

The name of the achievement to get

### Return Value

A [Float Stat](../types/float-stat.md) or [Int Stat](../types/int-stat.md) value indicates rather or not the process was valid (API name found and read) and what the value read was.

Global stats return the value as a float or int directly, history stats return via a callback event an array containing the values and a [UEResult](../enumerators/ueresult.md) indicating the status of the request.
