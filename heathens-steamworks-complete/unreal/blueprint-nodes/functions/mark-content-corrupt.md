## Introduction

Allows you to force verify game content on the next launch.

If you detect the game is out-of-date (for example, by having the client detect a version mismatch with a server), you can use MarkContentCorrupt to force a verification, show a message to the user, and then quit.

### Return Value

True if the Steam API has been initialized, false otherwise
