## Introduction

Sets the game server associated with the lobby.

This can only be set by the owner of the lobby.

Either the IP/Port or the Steam ID of the game server must be valid, depending on how you want the clients to be able to connect.

{% hint style="info" %}
This will raise the [Lobby Game Created](../events/lobby-game-created.md) callback for all members.\
\
Once this has been set any new members can read the data by using [Get Lobby Game  Server](get-lobby-game-server.md).
{% endhint %}
