## Introduction

Gets the list of friends of a given type related to the user.

Heathen exposes the native count and gets methods as well as an array-based implementation.

### Flag

The flag indicates what kind of friends to fetch a list for ... the "Immediate" option is the typical flag used and returns the "normal" friends that you would see in the Steam client's friends list.

Learn more about the different flag options at the link below
