## Introduction

Removes a metadata key from the lobby.

This can only be done by the owner of the lobby.

This will only send the data if the key exists. There is a slight delay before sending the data so you can call this repeatedly to set all the data you need to and it will automatically be batched up and sent after the last sequential call.

### Lobby Id

The ID of the lobby to delete the metadata for

### Key

The key to delete the data for
