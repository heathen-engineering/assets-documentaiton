## Introduction

Invite another user to the lobby.\
\
If the specified user clicks the join link, a [Game Lobby Join Requested](../friends/lobby-join-requested.md) callback will be posted if the user is in-game, or if the game isn't running yet then the game will be automatically launched with the command line parameter `+connect_lobby <64-bit lobby Steam ID>` instead.

### Lobby Id

The Steam ID of the lobby to invite the user to

### User Id

The user to invite to the lobby

### Return Value

**true** if the invite was successfully sent; otherwise, **false** if the local user isn't in a lobby, no connection to Steam could be made, or the specified user is invalid.
