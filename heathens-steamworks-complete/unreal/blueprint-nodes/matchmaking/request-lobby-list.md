## Introduction

To get a list of lobbies such as to populate a lobby browser, or far more commonly to simply take the first lobby returned and join it. You must first define your lobby filter, see the [Add Request Lobby List Filter](add-request-lobby-list-filter.md) article for more information on that process.&#x20;

When the filter has been established call Request Lobby List, this will have a single input called `Callback` which is an event that will report the count of lobbies found. You can then loop over that count and using Get Lobby by Index you can return the ID of each lobby returned.
