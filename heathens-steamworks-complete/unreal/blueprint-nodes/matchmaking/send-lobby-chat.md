## Introduction

Broadcasts a chat (text or binary data) message to the all of the users in the lobby.\
\
All users in the lobby (including the local user) will receive a [Lobby Chat Msg](lobby-chat-msg.md) callback with the message.\
\
If you're sending binary data, you should prefix a header to the message so that you know to treat it as your custom data rather than a plain old text message.\
\
For communication that needs to be arbitrated (for example having a user pick from a set of characters, and making sure only one user has picked a character), you can use the lobby owner as the decision maker. [Get Lobby Owner](get-lobby-owner.md) to return the current lobby owner. There is guaranteed to always be one and only one lobby member who is the owner. So for the choose-a-character scenario, the user who is picking a character would send the binary message 'I want to be Zoe', the lobby owner would see that message, see if it was OK, and broadcast the appropriate result (user X is Zoe).\
\
These messages are sent via the Steam back-end, and so the bandwidth available is limited. For higher-volume traffic like voice or game data, you'll want to use the [Steam Networking API](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/multiplayer/networking).
