## Introduction

Send the changed stats and achievements data to the server for permanent storage.

If this fails then nothing is sent to the server. It's advisable to keep trying until the call is successful.

This call can be rate-limited. Call frequency should be on the order of minutes, rather than seconds. You should only be calling this during major state changes such as the end of a round, the map changing, or the user leaving a server. This call is required to display the achievement unlock notification dialogue.

### Return Value

True if the call was successful
