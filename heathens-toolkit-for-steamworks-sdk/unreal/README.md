## Introduction

The articles within are specific to Unreal and include the engine-specific tools and systems unique to the Unity version of the package.&#x20;

## Features

### Knowledge Base

The single most valuable resource we offer is completely free and you are reading it right now. Our Knowledge Base is a huge repository of invaluable information not limited to the support of our tools but covering every aspect of the Steam platform and Steamworks SDK and dipping into general game design, development and operation.

### Full-Featured Steamworks SDK

We expose the native Steamworks SDK to you in both C++ and Blueprints and extend that with quality-of-life and convenience additions to help you Do More with less and deliver a more robust integration by leveraging our decade+ of experience and refinement.&#x20;

### Deep Engine Integration

> More than just another API wrapper

That is literal, we do more than simply wrap up the old-school C-style Steamworks SDK into a more modern set of window trimming. We build on top of Steamworks with editor extensions and engine-specific features to make working with Steam as "native" feeling to the engine you choose as possible. Our extensions are an extension, not a replacement, the full, unadulterated Steamwroks SDK is at your command as well as our robust proven systems and tools.

### Work Your Way

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><h2>C++</h2></td><td>Simple full access to the native Steam APIs in C++ with no faffing about required.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><h2>Blueprints</h2></td><td>Access every function and event available through Steam API in Blueprints no C++ required.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><h2>Tools</h2></td><td>Steam Save Game, Steam Game Instance, prebuilt widgets, Sample level and much more.</td><td>Do More with Heathen!</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Proved Reliability

We have developed and maintained Heathen's Steamworks Complete for more than a decade. In that time we have learned a lot not just about Steam and the engines we support but what a developer needs to deliver a successful project. Heathen's Steamworks Complete is trusted by thousands of developers big and small and drives hundreds of games from small passion projects to major professional titles.

### Peerless Support

This is our day job, we are always here and we support our tools and our community. The community we have fostered is rich, diverse and supportive. Whether you are a passionate hobbyist looking to publish your first game on Steam or an industry veteran with years of experience Heathen's dedication and experience and the wider Heathen community will enable you Do More!

### But Online Subsystem Steam?

{% hint style="success" %}
Heathen's Steamworks Complete will save you hundreds if not thousands of hours and enable you to exploit every feature Valve's Steamworks provides easily, efficiently, stably and robustly.
{% endhint %}

[Online Subsystem Steam](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/online-subsystem-steam-interface-in-unreal-engine/) is a barebones integration of the basics and is built on an outdated version of Steam API that depending on your use case will simply not work. Documentation for Online Subsystem Steam is similarly dated and incomplete making it difficult to leverage Steam in any capacity beyond the most basic initialization. The lobby feature of Online Subsystem Steam is particularly limited and only suitable as a discovery system which is not what the feature was designed for at all giving you the worst of both worlds.

Setting aside the poor documentation for Online Subsystem Steam and the fact that it's on an older version of Steam API, it also simply lacks many of Valve's Steamworks' most valuable features and what is covered is only partially covered. The fact that it is outdated also presents risks regarding authentication and similar security features.

Importantly you should understand that any "Online Subsystem" is an attempt at shoehorning a given platform's features into the form expected by the Online Subsystem Framework. This means you cannot take full advantage of the platform, you cannot leverage all the features available and you must use the limited integration in the Unreal-defined manner, in the case of Steam API this is hugely limiting and greatly reduces the value of Steam APIs which is a rather large, expansive and incredibly feature reach kit.

#### In Contrast:

Heathen's Steamworks Complete is as its name suggests a complete solution. Our plugin is kept up to date with Valve's Steamworks SDK and the version of the SDK used can be changed by you with minimal effort (no code change required just swap assemblies).

#### More than "Just Another Steam API Wrapper"

Heathen's Steamworks Complete exposes the whole of Steamworks in C++ code of course and everything is also exposed to Blueprints in an Unreal friendly manner. Beyond that, we have created systems, tools and extensions that bridge the concepts and approaches of Unreal and Steam, for example, the Steam Game Instance, Steam Save Game, etc. The goal of the kit is to enable you to do more and to make Steam feel like a native extension of the engine you choose.
