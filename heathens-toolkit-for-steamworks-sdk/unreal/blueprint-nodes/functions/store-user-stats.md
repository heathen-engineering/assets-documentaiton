## Introduction

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only valid for Steam Game Servers
{% endhint %}

Send the changed stats and achievements data to the server for permanent storage for the specified user.\
\
If this fails then nothing is sent to the server. It's advisable to keep trying until the call is successful.\
\
This call can be rate-limited. Call frequency should be on the order of minutes, rather than seconds. You should only be calling this during major state changes such as the end of a round, the map changing, or the user leaving a server.\
\
If you have stats or achievements that you have saved locally but haven't uploaded with this function when your application process ends then this function will automatically be called.\
\
You can find additional debug information written to the `%steam_install%\logs\stats_log.txt` file.

### User

The user to store stats for

### Callback

An event delegate that will be executed when the process completes and will indicate the state and user.
