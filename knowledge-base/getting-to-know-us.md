# Getting to know us

Heathen Group was founded in 2015 as Heathen Engineering Limited by a small team of experienced software engineers and technology consultants. The company’s objective was and is to create and exploit software technologies, systems, and practices developing for and supporting both fellow creators and end users such as gamers.

Efforts aim to enable ourselves and our peers to develop a more consumer-centric game industry. This requires a high level of technical quality, a required depth of care in user experience and general design, and importantly fair, ethical, and sustainable monetization systems and practices.

Heathen has a particular focus on game software development and related technologies, though its pedigree is largely in the enterprise software sector. Heathen’s unique blend of experiences and understanding straddles multi-media entertainment and enterprise-level business and industry with decades of experience in both worlds.

## Our Approach

The approach taken by Heathen is simple: “Eat your own dog food”. Heathen creates technologies and tools that it then exploits to create end-user products such as bespoke client software, games, and assets. The Heathen approach creates a feedback loop where the use of its technologies and tools enriches its end-user products and the use of its products enriches its technologies and tools.&#x20;

Every tool, practice, or system we produce was born of a need in a real project. For tools of wider use, we abstract and make them publicly available. Through the support and fostering of our developer community, we enrich our public offerings making them more robust, more efficient, and more valuable and this intern enriches our games and apps and creates opportunities for new ideas, technologies, and systems to develop.
