# Introduction

## Overview

Heathen Lore is where we share our research and collections into cultural, historical and generally public domain lore making it freely available to all creators who might have a use for it.

Our first focus will be on pre-Christian (\~12,500 BCE to \~500 CE) Irish lore and mythology from folk and fairy tails through historical events, mythology and indigenous religion.

### Why pre-Christian Irish?

This is a special topic to us … you know … being an Irish company and all. This is also a topic that is sadly lacking in resources. Its hard for a story teller to do the same sort of deep research into Irish traditions as one can with Nordic, Slavic, Greek, etc. due simply to the absolute lack of materials and what is present, is well intended we are sure, but of questionable quality for story tellers and other creatives.

## What This Is?

This is not an academic or scholarly resource its a resource for creatives such as writers, game designers, visual artists and really anyone that wants know more behind the lore of these topics.

While we will of course check, cross reference and clearly annotate our sources similar to academic articles these pages will be structured much more like a Dungeons and Dragons dungeon masters guide or Warhammer player manual than any research paper you have read.

## Why Is This?

We love good stories, history, lore and culture and wants to insure creators have the tools to hand to create great works inspired by the great stories from our shared history. Thankfully many such stories, ideas and characters are already masterfully preserved and well available; however some such as those from pre-Christian Ireland are sadly lacking and little known.&#x20;

In response Heathen will invest its time, money and energy into gathering what is available, researching, reconstructing and developing what we are capable of, and most importantly making it all available publicly and encouraging creators to exploit what we have and maybe contribute where they can.

At the end of the day creators having more tools to tell more stories is really the point.

## How to Contribute

### Content

Reach out to[ Loden | Heathen Engineering](https://discord.gg/6X3xrRc) over on our Discord and we will get the ball rolling from there.

### Support / Funding

You can reach out to Loden as noted above though we are not looking for outside funding. If you really want to support Heathen simply [sponsor us on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/heathen-engineering) or purchase any of our assets from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/5836). While this is an open and free feature we want to provide to all; we are a for-profit company and are not set up for general donations or charity.

## Organization

Each topic such as Ireland; will have its own set of sections as appropriate to that topic.&#x20;

Each section will be further divided into **Cannon** and **Derivative** articles.&#x20;

Cannon articles are articles on topics belonging to the context. So for example under Ireland > Artefacts > Cannon you can expect to find information on artefacts that would have been part of stories or events from that time and known by people of pre-Christian Ireland.

In contrast Derivative articles may have topics such as the Banshee which seems sourced from the 8th century and is derived from an earlier period concept but not something pre-Christian peoples have known or stories would have featured.

### Example

* Ireland
  * Beings
    * Cannon
      * Fir Bolg
      * Tuatha de Danann
    * Derivative
      * Banshee

Why separate them?

So you have that information,&#x20;

Are you creating a historical fantasy? then you may want to be as accurate to the period as you can thus removing the derivatives.&#x20;

If your constructing your own unique mythology derivative you may want to see the source separate form existing derivatives so you can branch your own path or emulate where you see fit.
