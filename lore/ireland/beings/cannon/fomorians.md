{% hint style="warning" %}
Where similarities are drawn between Tuatha Dé Danann and Norse mythology's pantheon one can draw similar parallels with Fomorians and Jötnar\
\
Similarly if one compares Tuatha Dé Danann to Olympians from Greco-Roman mythology the Fomorians may be comparable to the Elder gods or titans.\
\
Various sources attempt to relate Fomorians to raiders, Vikings or otherwise external antagonist including some references of inter mingling with the Tuatha Dé Danann

References to the Fomorians being more primal or elemental while the Tuatha Dé Danann are referenced as more "evolved" are common\
\
In particular though this group represents the "proto" beings as in typically predates others and acts as the antagonist in most cases tot he central subject of a story and so special care will need to be given when researching and detangling stories and information pertaining to them.
