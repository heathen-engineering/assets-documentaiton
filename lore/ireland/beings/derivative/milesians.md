Milesians is likely a derivative post Christianisation attempting to link to Irish lore with the adopted Abrahamic lore. In particular it seems a poetic tool to describe the subjugation and removal of the indigenous lore where in the Milesians are said to have "taken the world above" and put the "Tuatha DÃ© Danann in the world below"
