## Introduction

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only valid for Steam Game Servers
{% endhint %}

Unlocks an achievement for the specified user.

You must have called [Request User Stats](request-user-stats.md) and it needs to return successfully via its callback prior to calling this!

This call only modifies Steam's in-memory state and is very cheap. To submit the stats to the server you must call Store User Stats.

{% hint style="info" %}
This will work only on achievements that game servers are allowed to set. If the "Set By" field for this achievement is "Official GS" then only game servers that have been declared as officially controlled by you will be able to set it. To do this you must set the IP range of your official servers in the [Dedicated Servers](https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/dedicatedservers/) section of App Admin.
{% endhint %}
