# Development

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Heathen Engineering Banner Black.png>)

## Overview

Heathen being a small group doesn't provide productised development services. Every engagement we do is bespoke and tailored to the clientsâ€™ specifics. Consequently, this also means we have a finite capacity and may not be a fit for your project at this time due to practical constraints on our team.

{% hint style="info" %}
While Heathen is currently at capacity, and is not taking on any new projects we are always happy to have a chat.

You can reach us most easily on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/6X3xrRc) where each Heathen staff member is identified in the Heathen group or email us at [Heimdal@heathen.group](mailto://Heimdal@heathen.group); keep in mind email is slower so please give us a few days to respond.
