# ðŸ’¶ Pricing

{% hint style="info" %}
From 0 to Infinity and beyond ðŸš€

Ad Hoc means we tailor our services to your needs, this means pricing is also tailored.&#x20;



We have many requests that are serviced at no charge as part of our asset development and support function. We also maintain multiple contracts at or around our standard daily rate.



The best way to get a price is to reach out to us and start a conversation. You can DM [Loden | Heathen Engineering](https://discord.gg/6X3xrRc) on Discord or email us at [support@heathen.group](mailto://support@heathen.group)&#x20;
{% endhint %}

This depends on your needs, there are cases where your needs align with our asset development or other works so we can treat it as a user request and thus the cost will be minimal or perhaps even none.

On the far other end of that spectrum we also provide full professional services. These are tailored to your needs and can include but are not limited to: exclusivity, IP ownership transfer, service level agreement, maintenance plans, training and on going support, and much more.&#x20;

Our standard day rate is based at 1000â‚¬ a manhour day. This rate may be adjusted depending on your needs and the alignment of your request with Heathen's current efforts. We are also able to operate under a fixed "time and materials" based pricing structure.

In short there are many ways we can engage so we very likely have a solution that can meet your budgetary needs.
