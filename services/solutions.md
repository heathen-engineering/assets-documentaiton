# ⚔ Solutions

Modern game development demands are often beyond the scope and scale that a single studio or team can manage. The two main solutions to deal with that reality are to "staff up" or "partner up". Each method has its strengths and weaknesses and the right answer for your business, team and project will differ from others. We can help you explore and select the strategy that works best for your business, team and project and then help you execute on that strategy.

## Sourcing

Sourcing partners and contractors to handle aspects of your business or project can be a great solution for many indie and small studios. This lets you keep your internal team focused on the aspects of your business and project that are really important to you and leave the rest to seasoned professionals that have a passion for those other areas.

While a great solution to internal gaps the prospect of identifying and selecting trusted partners to fill your requirements can be daunting. This is where we come in, engage us at the level that suits you. From research and on demand advise to full end to end professional service management. Hel House can identify, select, engage and manage a wide array of professional services.&#x20;
