## Introduction

Achievements are a simple and traditional feature for games that can help drive player engagement. They can also act as a poor-mans Game Statistics feature, for example, you can set achievements to unlock at particular milestones and then monitor the game's global stats to see what % of your player base has unlocked each achievement giving an idea of how your game's retention looks.

## Quick Start

First, you need to create your achievements on the Steam Developer portal. [https://partner.steamgames.com/](https://partner.steamgames.com/)

### Create

Log into your Steam Developer Portal and access your app's admin page. Look for the Technical Tools section and select the Edit Steamworks Settings option.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="Techincal Tools"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From there select the Stats & Achievements > Achievements option and create your new achievements.&#x20;

Make note of the value you use in the API Name field. You will use it when working with achievements in code.&#x20;

In Unity, if you prefer to work with Achievements via an object reference then you can use our [AchievementObject ](../toolkit-for-steamworks/unity/classes-and-structs/achievement-object.md)which is a Unity ScriptableObject that can be referenced and accessed like any other Unity Object.

### Publish

You \*\***MUST**\*\* publish your changes in Steam Developer Portal before they will be accessible via Steam API. In the Steam Developer Portal when you have pending changes you will see a red banner at the top of the screen ... click it and follow the instructions.

## Using Achievements

The first thing to understand is that with stats and achievements, the process of setting them in two steps.

1. You assign the value&#x20;
2. You store the changes in the backend

{% hint style="success" %}
Understand that not every game needs achievements, that if you're going to have achievements they should be part of the game and not an afterthought you bolted on because why not? Meaningless achievements can harm the user experience by breaking immersion or simply drawing attention away during gameplay.

Following are some ideas for meaningful achievements and how you might tie those achievements into other aspects of your game.
{% endhint %}

### Storing Stats and Achievements

This is the process of committing any changes made during gameplay to the Steam backend. That is you can freely "set" the state of achievements and stats during gameplay such as incrementing kills of enemy units, player score, etc. These changes are written to the local cash, not directly to the backend.

When the game is closed or when you call "Store" the changes will be committed to the backend. This should be done at key points in the game such as at the end of a level, on player death, when a boss is defeated or at some other opportune time. It is generally not recommended that you constantly call Store() with each change.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Think about when you want that popup to show\
It will be immersion-breaking, it could cover parts of the screen, and it could cause things such as Windows Auto HDR to cause screen flicker ... in generally you want it to show only when the player is not actively engaged in gameplay such as on a menu, debriefing, "You Died" screen, etc.
{% endhint %}

There are several ways to store stats and achievements and they all do the same thing. They are simply different ways you can trigger the effect depending on what objects you have available in memory and how you are more comfortable as a developer.

### Pop up

The Steam popup that you're used to seeing when you unlock an achievement or receive some other notification is not code in the game but rather the Steam client rendering overtop the game's window.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Players can force this to be disabled so do not assume it will always be present it's the user's choice as configured in the Steam client, not your game. This is not for you to control.
{% endhint %}

For achievements, this popup triggers when an achievement is [stored ](achievements.md#storing-achievements)not when it is set. Also, note that because it is rendering over the game window it will not likely work properly when testing in the Unity Editor or if you have a debugger or other app mounted to the process as this may restrict window updates and or add additional windows to the process.

### New Player Experience

Think of your achievements like a meta quest ...&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Meta means beyond or above, etc. and when we use it we mean a concept, information, etc. that is not part of the main but additional and external to it.
{% endhint %}

Like a meta quest, that is a quest for the player (not the character in-game world) to learn your game. To encourage them to explore the features and functions of your game in a structured manner and to offer some non-gameplay impacting rewards for doing so.

For a practical example of this see DOTA 2's "New Player Experience" aka "Welcome Quests" where they present "quests" for new players to do simple things like open menus, use features, review information, play each of the game modes, etc. Importantly this is not hidden from the player it's presented to the player in the menu just like a quest, showing what steps are yet to be done and which have been done.

{% endembed %}

### Player Tutorial

The best tutorials are fun and engaging parts of the game that happen to also teach the player mechanics, concepts, demonstrate tactics and strategies and more. Similar to the New Player Experience approach you can use Achievements as a means to draw attention to these instructions and reward their completion without forcing the player into them.

### Item Rewards

Steam Inventory is a huge topic unto itself that needs its own guide. The overlay with Achievements is that you can restrict eligibility for Item Promotion drops based on unlocked achievements. You can use this with New Player Experience or Tutorial style achievements to award in-game items for completing the tasks.

### Achievement Hunters

There are many types of players and a common one across all game genres is the "Collector" or "Hunter" This is a type of player that likes to "100%" the game. Be careful to not bloat your game with meaningless achievements as this will simply frustrate the collector but do make sure to track and reward them for fully exploring your game.

### Player Retention Monitoring

Did you know you can view the global stats for games that have achievements seeing what % of the player base has achieved each achievement?

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Well now you do, this means you can use achievements to understand (vaguely) what parts of your game are used and what are not, used well and you can track where players "fall off".

## Creating Achievements

> #### [Valve](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/achievements)
>
> Steam Stats and Achievements provides an easy way for your game to provide persistent, roaming achievement and statistics tracking for your users. The user's data is associated with their Steam account, and each user's achievements and statistics can be formatted and displayed in their Steam Community Profile.

Achievements like stats are created in your [Steam Developer Portal](https://partner.steamgames.com/), once created there you can access them via their ID, if you are not using Heathen's Steamworks ... why aren't you, it has a free version. Then you can import your Stats and Achievements into Unity or use our [AchievementData ](../toolkit-for-steamworks/unity/classes-and-structs/achievement-data.md)structure to easily work with your achievements in code.

Valve's documentation on the [Stats and Achievement](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/achievements) features is a good place to get started.

## Examples

### Set Achievement

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Toolkit for Unity" %}
This assumes myAch is an [AchievementObject ](../toolkit-for-steamworks/unity/classes-and-structs/achievement-object.md)or [AchievementData](../toolkit-for-steamworks/unity/classes-and-structs/achievement-data.md)

```csharp
myAch.IsAchieved = true;
// or
myAch.Unlock();

//You can also do this with the API Extensions
//Assuming you have a using statement such as
using Achievements = HeathenEngineering.SteamworksIntegration.API.StatsAndAchievements.Client;

//Then
Achievements.SetAchievement("The Achievement API Name");
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Tookit for Unreal" %}
## Blueprint

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## C++

```cpp
bool result = SteamUserStats()->SetAchievement(StringCast<ANSICHAR>(*apiName).Get());
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Steamworks.NET" %}
```csharp
SteamUserStats.SetAchievement(achievementApiName, achieved);
```
{% endtab %}

var isAchieved = myAch.IsAchieved;

//When was this unlocked
var dateTime = myAch.UnlockTime;

//What is the icon for this achievement
//This is an asynchronous call so its parameter is a delegate
//that will be run when the call is completed
myAch.GetIcon(texture2D =>
{
    //texture2D is a UnityEngine.Texture2D that can be used as needed
    //This will be the icon the user sees e.g. if the achievement is unlocked
    //this will be the unlocked version
    //if the achievement is locked it will be the locked version
    //If you unlock the achievement or if its status changes you can get the icon again
    //to get the new icon version
});

//You can read the achievements of other uses once you have their data
var achState = myAch.GetAchievementAndUnlockTime(user);
//The return is a tuple that defines the unlocked
var isAchieved = achState.unlocked;
//and unlock time
var dateTime = achState.unlockTime;

<strong>//You can also do this with the API Extensions
