## &#x20;Introduction

Cloud save also known as Steam Remote Storage allows you to save a file and have it synced to the "cloud" e.g. Steam's servers so that the same file is available to that user on any machine they log into.

Quote from Valve's documentation

> The Steam Cloud provides an easy and transparent remote file storage system for your game. Files specified in the Auto-Cloud configuration or written to disk (created, modified, deleted, etc.) using the Cloud API will automatically be replicated to the Steam servers after the game exits.
>
> If the user changes computers, the files are automatically downloaded to the new computer before the game launches. The game can then access the files by reading them through the Cloud API or reading them directly from the disk as usual. Avoid machine-specific configurations such as video settings.
>
> The Steam Client does the work of ensuring that the files are kept synchronized across all computers the user may be accessing.
>
> Users can globally disable Cloud synchronization in the Steam Settings under Cloud by unchecking "Enable Steam Cloud synchronization for applications which support it."
