## Quick Start

First, you need to create your DLC on the Steam Developer portal. [https://partner.steamgames.com/](https://partner.steamgames.com/)

### Create

Log into your Steam Developer Portal and access your app's admin page. Look for the Technical Tools section and select the Edit Steamworks Settings option.

Populate the form with the names of the DLC you would like to create making sure to start the name with the name of your game. For example, our game's name is TÃºatha Legends so we might a DLC something like TÃºatha Legends - The Iron King

### Publish

You \*\***MUST**\*\* publish your changes in the Steam Developer Portal before they will be accessible via Steam API. In the Steam Developer Portal when you have pending changes you will see a red banner at the top of the screen ... click it and follow the instructions.
