## Introduction

So you have built your game and your ready to push it up to Steam but your not quite sure how to do this. This article will describe the two main methods to getting your game build up to Steam as well as some of the administrative features around Steam builds and depots as they relate to the topic.

Valve's official documentation on the subject is required reading!

## Zip Upload

If your game is small enough you can upload it as a zip file in the Steam Developer Portal.

In short if the resulting zip file is smaller than 2gb you can upload it in the Steam Pipe -> Builds -> Upload Depots option.

## Steam CMD

Steam CMD has a feature "Content Builder" which is the traditional way to upload your games and in our opinion the better method. Your first step is to download the Steamworks SDK, this is a zip file that has a slew of tools and examples meant to help you get to terms with the Steamworks tools.

{% hint style="info" %}
In short, we are going to create a script that will run SteamCMD and tell it to read another script called an "app build vdf" ... that app build vdf is just a script that describes what app it is we want to upload for and what depots we want to upload to.\


The app build vdf further references "depot build configuration vdf" files that detail each depot that will be leveraged and what that depot reads

Once you have that downloaded you should unpack it to a location on your local machine. The folder your looking for within the SDK is the SDK -> Tools -> ContentBuilder folder.

In short you can use a couple simple commands to upload your build to Steam via Steam CMD. This set up can even be scripted so that all you need to do is run your script.

### Run Build Script

To get started lets create the script that you will actually execute to upload your builds, follows is a template you can use.

```
builder\steamcmd.exe +login [Username] [Password] +run_app_build_http ..\scripts\app_build_[appid].vdf +quit
pause
```

To use the above template open up note pad or your preferred plain text editor and past that command in. Next we are going to replace the following text

* \[Username]\
  This should be your Steam User Name that you use for the Steam Developer Portal
* \[Password]\
  This is the password for that same account
* \[appid]\
  This is the numeric app id that you want to upload

Next save the file to the ContentBuilder folder ... we suggest you give it a name such as `run_build_MyGameName.bat` this will make it easier to sort, search and remember which app this goes to.

This script does the following things

1. Run SteamCmd
2. Log in as the user you indicated
3. run app build web API providing the script you named e.g. the `..\scripts\app_build_#####.vdf`

The final command there is passing in a file as part of the argument ... a file located in the scripts folder, its that vdf file that describes what is to be uploaded, where the content should be read from and what depots it should be pushed to.

You can create variations of this script for different builds and different apps, this gives you a 1 click way to upload all your content and you can even have it upload multiple builds at once.

How?\
The next section covers it.

### VDFs

The .vdf format from Valve does 2 things, there are:

* "appbuild" \
  These VDFs describe what is to be upload e.g. the app id, the description of the build, the content folder the build content can be found in, etc.
* "DepotBuildConfig"\
  These VDFs describe the depot its self that an upload should push to, this will include the depot ID and its file mapping information as well as any file exclusion rules such as explcuding \*.pdb files from being uploaded

#### Template App Build VDF

This should be saved in the scripts folder with a name such as `app_build_####.vdf` where the ### is your app ID.

```json
"appbuild"
{
	"appid"	"[appId]"
	"desc" "[description]" // description for this build
	"buildoutput" "..\output\" // build output folder for .log, .csm & .csd files, relative to location of this file
	"contentroot" "..\content\[gameFolder]\" // root content folder, relative to location of this file
	"setlive"	"" // branch to set live after successful build, non if empty
	"preview" "0" // to enable preview builds
	"local"	""	// set to flie path of local content server 
	
	"depots"
	{
		"[DepotId]" "depot_build_[DepotId].vdf"
	}
}
```

You should replace the text defined below with the values appropreate for your game

* \[appId]\
  The app ID this build is in relation to
* \[description]\
  The description of this build ... this is usually something like "MyGame's base build" or "MyGame's Windows Build"
* \[gameFolder]\
  This is the location of your build content, and as you can see we assume your putting your build in the SDK -> Tools -> ContentBuilder -> content folder. We recomend you make sub-folders in that for each game ... and for each platform ... for example
  * sdk/tools/ContentBuilder/content/MyGame/Windows
  * sdk/tools/ContentBuilder/content/MyGame/Linux
  * sdk/tools/ContentBuilder/content/MyOtherGame/Windows
* \[DepotId]\
  This is the list of DepotBuildConfig files to be included, it is an array so you can include more than 1 for example

```json
"depots"
{
    "123456" "depot_build_123456.vdf",
    "234567" "depot_build_234567.vdf"
}
```

The Depot Build Config define what content they will read or not from the content folder they are pointed to. How this works will make more since as you read over the template for the Depot Build Configuration

#### Template Depot Build Configuration VDF

This should be saved in the scripts folder with a name such as depot`_build_####.vdf` where the ### is your depot ID.

```json
"DepotBuildConfig"
{
	"DepotID" "[DepotId]"
	"ContentRoot"	"[RootFolderOfTheGame ... where the platform folders live]"

  "FileMapping"
  {
  	// This can be a full path, or a path relative to ContentRoot
    "LocalPath" ".\[Platform]\*"
    
    "DepotPath" "."
    
    "recursive" "1"
  }

  "FileExclusion" "*.pdb"
}
```

Here we will replace the following text

* \[DepotId]\
  This is the depots ID as seen in Steam Developer Portal and is a number such as 123456
* \[RootFolderOfTheGame ... where the platform folder live]]\
  This is the root folder where the content will read from ... for example\
  `C:\Builds\ContentBuilder\content\MyGame`
* \[Platform]\
  This is a sub-folder within the content root so if I entered the value `.\Windows\*` then I am telling it to read all files and folders in `C:\Builds\ContentBuilder\content\MyGame\Windows`

### Run It

Once you have the 3 layers of scripts created that is the Run Build Script, the App Build VDF and the Depot Build Config VDFs you can now upload your build by simply running the "Run Build Script" you set up.\
\
This can now be easily tied into your build process if your using one or even ran manually by double clicking the bat file.&#x20;
