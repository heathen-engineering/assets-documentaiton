## &#x20;Introduction

{% embed url="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/voice" %}

Steam Voice helps you record voice data from the local user and prepare it for sending. It also helps you consume that data and play it back.

Steam Voice does not deal with the sending of data. How you choose to send data from one user to another is a matter of how you handle networking in your game. Steam does provide networking tools or you can use any other networking solution you might like.
