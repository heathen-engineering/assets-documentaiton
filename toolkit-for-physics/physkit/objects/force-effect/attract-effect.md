## Introduction

A basic configurable effect which applies its force toward the origin of the Force Effect source. The mode by which force is applied is configurable in the settings of the effect.

## Angular

If enable and listening the Angular effect will attempt to rotate the subject to face the direction of the force origin.

## Linear

Simply applies the force  in the direction of the origin.
