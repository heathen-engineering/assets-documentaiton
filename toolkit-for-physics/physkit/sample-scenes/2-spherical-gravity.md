## Introduction

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Sphere Grav.png>)

This scene demonstrates a more typical use of the [Force Effect framework](../core-features/force-effect-framework.md); spherical gravity. You will find a sphere center of the screen with a number of objects placed around it. The sphere has a [Force Effect Field](../components/force-effect-source/force-effect-field.md) configured to use the [Gravity Effect](../objects/force-effect/gravity-effect.md).&#x20;

## What do I Learn?

1. What is a [Force Effect](../api/force-effects.md)
2. What is a [Force Effect Source](../components/force-effect-source/)
3. What is a [Force Effect Reciever](../components/force-effect-reciever.md)&#x20;
4. Use of the [Gravity Effect](../objects/force-effect/gravity-effect.md)

## Objects

### Planet

The planet is a simple sphere mesh along with a [Force Effect Field](../components/force-effect-source/force-effect-field.md) with the [Gravity Effect](../objects/force-effect/gravity-effect.md) configured.

### Objects

This is a collection of spheres and cubes configured as [Force Effect Receivers](../components/force-effect-reciever.md)
