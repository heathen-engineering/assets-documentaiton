## Introduction

Heathen's Toolkit for Steamworks comes with several sample scenes that demonstrate common functionality.

{% hint style="info" %}
These example scenes are designed to work with App 480 (Spacewars) and may not work as expected with your app ID without making changes to configuration and or example code.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Sample scripts are samples and are not fit for production use.\
\
For this reason, we mark all sample scripts as "Obsolete" such that they have a big warning in the editor that they are not for production use.\
\
Sample scripts no matter who creates them are created to be verbose and instruct new programmers and developers on the use of a given tool or technology. They are not an example of efficient practical use no matter what the author may say as they are not designed for your specific project, team, code style, etc.. \
\
You should **ALWAYS** treat sample code as a sample that you learn from and use to write your working, practical, efficient and appropriate for your project version.&#x20;
