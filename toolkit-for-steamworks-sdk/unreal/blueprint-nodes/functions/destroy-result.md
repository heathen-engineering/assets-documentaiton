## Introduction

Destroys a result handle and frees all associated memory.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you use the "Simple" variant of nodes that effect items this is not needed and you will not have a result handle that needs to be destroyed.\
\
See the following for examples

* [Add Promo Item](add-promo-item.md)
* [Add Promo Items](add-promo-items.md)
* [Consume Item](consume-item.md)
* [Deserialize Result](deserialize-result.md)
* [Exchange Items](exchange-items.md)
* [Generate Items](generate-items.md)
* [Get All Items](get-all-items.md)
{% endhint %}
