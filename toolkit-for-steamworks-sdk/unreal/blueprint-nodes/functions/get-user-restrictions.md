## Introduction

Check if the current user is chat-restricted.

If they are restricted, then they can't send or receive any text/voice chat messages, and can't see custom avatars. A chat-restricted user can't add friends or join any groups. Restricted users can still be online and send/receive game invites.

### Return Value

The User Restriction value if known
