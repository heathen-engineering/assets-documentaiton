## Introduction

Triggers an asynchronous load and refresh of item definitions.

Item definitions are a mapping of "definition IDs" (integers between 1 and 999999999) to a set of string properties. Some of these properties are required to display items on the Steam community website. Other properties can be defined by applications. There is no reason to call this function if your game hardcoded the numeric definition IDs (e.g. purple face mask = 20, blue weapon mod = 55) and does not allow for adding new item types without a client patch.
