## Introduction

Starts a transaction request to update [dynamic properties](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/inventory/dynamicproperties) on items for the current user. This call is rate-limited by the user, so property modifications should be batched as much as possible (e.g. at the end of a map or game session). After calling [Set Property](set-property.md) or [Remove Property](remove-property.md) for all the items that you want to modify, you will need to call [Submit Update Properties](submit-update-property.md) to send the request to the Steam servers. A [Steam Inventory Result Ready](../events/inventory-results-ready.md) callback will be fired with the results of the operation.

### Return Value

Returns an Update Handle that can be used with Set Property, Remove Property and Submit Update Properties.
