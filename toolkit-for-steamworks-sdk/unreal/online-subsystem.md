Online Subsystem and the Steam variant Online Subsystem Steam are fully compatible with Heathen's Toolkit for Steamworks SDK, however in general we do not recommend you use them as they greatly limit some of the most valuable features of the Steamworks SDK and the Steam platform as a whole.

In order to use Steam Networking Sockets you will find it necessary to install Online Subsystem Steam as it is a technical requirement for the Steam Sockets plugin. You don't have to use its features for matchmaking, session discovery or management and in general wont want to.
