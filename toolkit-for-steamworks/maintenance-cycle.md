# Maintenance Cycle

All Heathen tools have paid maintenance. If you purchase from Unity Asset Store or FAB Marketplace you will receive updates for that year's version only. On or around 1st November we will release the next version which you can upgrade to for 20% of its base price.

{% hint style="info" %}
Gace Period\
If you purchase "near" the release of the next version you will get access to that version for free. \
\
The length of this grace period is not entirely under our control so we do not state what it will be however it should always be > 30 days and can be as long as 90 days. If you have any questions we are [here ](https://discord.gg/heathen-group-463483739612381204)to answer them.
{% endhint %}

## When?

1st November of each year.\
Or as close as is possible given Unity's tendency to shadow drop events and launchges that effect our plans.

## Why?

Put plainly it costs us time and money to maintain the toolkits and react to changes in the applicable platforms and technology, thus we have to charge for the service.

The only channel Unity Asset Store or FAB Marketplace offers to do that is via paid updates. If you are a [GitHub Sponsor or Patreon](../become-a-sponsor/) this doesn't apply to you because you are paying for a month of upgrades with each month that you are subscribed.

There is no free updates for life option from any legitimate source.

## How Much?

20% of the new version price per year version.

Examples:

* 2025 to 2026 = 80% off - $20
* 2025 to 2027 = 60% off - $40&#x20;
* 2025 to 2028 = 40% off - $80

## Do I have to upgrade?

No, you can continue to use the prior version for as long as you like, we DO NOT remove access to anything you own ever, nor does Unity. Licenses are perpetual and do not expire. Code will continue to funciton as it had. Valve, Unity and Microsoft may release breaking changes you can however use older versions of there offerings as well and remain on whatever version makes you happy.

## What does deprecated mean?

This is what Unity calls it when we mark a version to no longer be sold. It will still show up in your library, you can still download it and use it. It simply will not show up in the store to new users and it will not receive any new updates from us.

You can still get "community support" which means you can ask questions and we and the community as your peers and fellow game developers will do our best to help you.

If you need a patch, a hot fix, an update more formalized technical support, etc. then you need to be on the "active" version either by joining GitHub Sponsor, Patreon or by purchasing the update in FAB or Unity Asset Store.
