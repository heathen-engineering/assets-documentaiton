All Heathen tools have paid upgrades. If you purchase from Unity Asset Store or FAB Marketplace you will receive updates for that major version only. On or around 1st November we will release the next major version which you can upgrade to for 20% of its base price.

## When?

1st November of each year.

## Why?

Put plainly it costs us time and money to maintain the toolkits and react to changes in the applicable platforms and technology, thus we have to charge for the service.

The only channel Unity Asset Store or FAB Marketplace offers to do that is via Major Upgrade. If you are a [GitHub Sponsor or Patreon](../become-a-sponsor/) this doesn't apply to you because you are paying for a month of upgrades with each month that you are subscribed.

There is no free updates for life option from any legitimate source.

## How Much?

20% of the new version price per version upgraded.

Examples:

* v3 to v4 = 80% off.
* v2 to v4 = 60% off
* v1 to v4 = 40% off

## Do I have to upgrade?

No, you can continue to use the prior version for as long as you like, we DO NOT remove access to anything you own ever, nor does Unity. Licenses are perpetual and do not expire.

## What does deprecated mean?

This is what Unity calls it when we mark a version to no longer be sold. It will still show up in your library, you can still download it and use it. It simply will not show up in the store to new users and it will not receive any new updates.
