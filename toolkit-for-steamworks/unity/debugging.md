You need to press play and run the game in the editor for the Inspector to work. It is dependent on the Steamworks SDK being initalzied. It will display the settings and state for the App ID that is initialized if any.

Note that if you have not configured Steam Settings for the app you want to debug then this can't work. To Configure Steam Settings check your Project Settings / Player / Steamworks.
