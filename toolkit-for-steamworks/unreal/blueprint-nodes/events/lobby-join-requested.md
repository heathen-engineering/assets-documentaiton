## Introduction

Called when the user tries to join a lobby from their friend's list or from an invite. The game client should attempt to connect to the specified lobby when this is received. If the game isn't running yet then the game will be automatically launched with the command line parameter `+connect_lobby <64-bit lobby Steam ID>` instead.

### Lobby Id

The Steam ID of the lobby to connect to.

### User Id

The friend they joined through. This will be invalid if not directly via a friend.
