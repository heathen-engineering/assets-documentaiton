## Introduction

Decodes the compressed voice data returned by [Get Voice](get-voice.md).\
\
The output data is raw single-channel 16-bit PCM audio. The decoder supports any sample rate from 11025 to 48000. See [Get Voice Optimal Sample Rate](get-voice-optimal-sample-rate.md) for more information.

### Compressed Data

The array of bytes that represents the compressed data

### Desired Sample Rate

The sample rate that will be returned. This can be from **11025** to **48000**, you should either use the rate that works best for your audio playback system, which likely takes the user's audio hardware into account, or you can use [Get Voice Optimal Sample Rate](get-voice-optimal-sample-rate.md) to get the native sample rate of the Steam voice decoder.

### Return Value

A [Decompress Voice Result](../types/decompress-voice-result.md) value containing the results and data of the process
