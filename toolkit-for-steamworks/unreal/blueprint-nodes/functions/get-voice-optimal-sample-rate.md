## Introduction

Gets the native sample rate of the Steam voice decoder.\
\
Using this sample rate for [Decompress Voice](decompress-voice.md) will perform the least CPU processing. However, the final audio quality will depend on how well the audio device (and/or your application's audio output SDK) deals with lower sample rates. You may find that you get the best audio output quality when you ignore this function and use the native sample rate of your audio output device, which is usually 48000 or 44100.
