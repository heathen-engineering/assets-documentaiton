## Introduction

Read captured audio data from the microphone buffer.\
\
The compressed data can be transmitted by your application and decoded back into raw audio data using [Decompress Voice](decompress-voice.md) on the other side. The compressed data provided is in an arbitrary format and is not meant to be played directly.\
\
This should be called once per frame, and at worst no more than four times a second to keep the microphone input delay as low as possible. Calling this any less may result in gaps in the returned stream.\
\
It is recommended that you pass in an 8 kilobytes or larger destination buffer for compressed audio. Static buffers are recommended for performance reasons. However, if you would like to allocate precisely the right amount of space for a buffer before each call you may use [GetAvailableVoice](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamUser#GetAvailableVoice) to find out how much data is available to be read.
