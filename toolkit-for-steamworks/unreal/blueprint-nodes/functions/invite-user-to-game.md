## Introduction

Invites a friend or clan member to the current game using a special invite string.\
\
If the target user accepts the invite then the pchConnectString gets added to the command-line when launching the game.\
If the game is already running for that user, then they will receive a [GameRichPresenceJoinRequested\_t](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamFriends#GameRichPresenceJoinRequested\_t) callback with the connect string.

### User ID (Input)

The user you want to invite

### Connection String (input)

### Return Value

True if the invite was successfully sent

False under the following conditions:

* The User ID provided was invalid.
* The User ID provided is not a friend or does not share the same Steam Group as the current user.
* The value provided to the Connection String was too long.
