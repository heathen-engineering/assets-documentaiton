## Introduction

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only valid for Steam Game Servers
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is not typical to use this Log On method as it requires the use of a Game Server Acocunt token. Far more commonly used would be the [Log On Anonymous](log-on-anonymous.md) option.
{% endhint %}

Begin the process of logging in to a persistent game server account.

This will trigger one of the following

* Servers Connected
* Server Connect Failure

### Token

For server token see [https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers) for more information.
