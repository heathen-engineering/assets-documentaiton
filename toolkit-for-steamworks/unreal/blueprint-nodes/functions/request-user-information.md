## Introduction

Requests the persona name and optionally the avatar of a specified user.

{% hint style="info" %}
It's slower to download avatars and churns the local cache, so if you don't need avatars, don't request them.
{% endhint %}

### User Id

The user to request the information for.

### Name Only

Retrieve the Persona name only (**true**)? Or both the name and the avatar (**false**)?

### Return Value

Triggers a [Persona State Change](../events/persona-state-change.md) callback.

**true** means that the data has been requested and a [Persona State Change](../events/persona-state-change.md) callback will be posted when it's retrieved.&#x20;

**false** means that we already have all the details about that user and functions that require this information can be used immediately.
