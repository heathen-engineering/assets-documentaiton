## Introduction

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only valid for Steam Game Servers
{% endhint %}

Dispatches callbacks created with STEAM\_GAMESERVER\_CALLBACK and call results to all of the registered listeners.

It's best to call this at >10Hz, the more time between calls, the more potential latency between receiving events or results from the Steamworks API. Most games call this once per render-frame. All registered listener functions will be invoked during this call, in the callers thread context.
