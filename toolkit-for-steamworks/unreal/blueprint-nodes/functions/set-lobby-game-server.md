## Introduction

Sets the game server associated with the lobby.

This can only be set by the owner of the lobby.

Either the IP/Port or the Steam ID of the game server must be valid, depending on how you want the clients to be able to connect.

{% hint style="info" %}
This will raise the [Lobby Game Created](../events/lobby-game-created.md) callback for all members.\
\
Once this has been set any new members can read the data by using [Get Lobby Game  Server](get-lobby-game-server.md).
{% endhint %}

## Nodes

You have 4 ways you can set this data depending on what kind of information you want to store and for what use.&#x20;

For example in a traditional Peer-to-Peer set up aka "Listen Server" the lobby owner is the "host" aka server and so we do not need any info thus the `Set Lobby Listen Server` doesn't require any input other than the server to set it on.

In a multiplex dedicated server, you may want to support Steam ID, as well as IP:Port and so the `Set Lobby Dedicated Server - ID and IP Address` is the option you want. In all cases these will all cause the same event to be raised for the members of the lobby.
