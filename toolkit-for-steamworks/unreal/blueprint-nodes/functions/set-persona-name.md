## Introduction

Changes take place locally immediately, and a [Persona State Change ](../events/persona-state-change.md)callback is posted, presuming success. If the name change fails to happen on the server, then an additional [Persona State Change](../events/persona-state-change.md) callback will be posted to change the name back, in addition to the final result available in the callback.&#x20;

#### Success

#### Local Success
