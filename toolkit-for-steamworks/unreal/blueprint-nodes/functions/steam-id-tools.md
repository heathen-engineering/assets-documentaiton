## Introduction

Valve uses Steam ID to uniquely identify many things such as users, lobbies, servers, chat rooms and more. In most cases, you will be using those IDs as you find them from friend lists, servers, lobby membership, etc.

In some cases, it is useful to read the parts that make up a Steam ID or use those parts to re-create a Steam ID.

A Steam ID is a complex number expressed as an int 64 and composed of several key parts ... see more information in this [article](../../../../steam/csteamid.md). The following nodes can be used to convert a Steam ID to and from Friend ID and Hex values as it relates to a User's Steam ID
