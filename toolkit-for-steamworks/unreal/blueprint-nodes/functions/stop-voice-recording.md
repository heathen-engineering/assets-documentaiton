## Introduction

Stops voice recording.\
\
Because people often release push-to-talk keys early, the system will keep recording for a little bit after this function is called. As such, [Get Voice](get-voice.md) should continue to be called until it returns [Not Recording](../enumerators/uevoiceresult.md), only then will voice recording be stopped.
