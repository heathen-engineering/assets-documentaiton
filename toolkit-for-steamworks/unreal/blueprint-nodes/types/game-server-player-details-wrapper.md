## Introduction

The entirety of Valve's documentation on this object is as follows

> const char \*pchName, int nScore, float flTimePlayed\
> Called when we retrieved data on a new player on the server -- you'll get this callback once per player on the server which you have requested player data on.

Below are our assumptions and observations of the values

### Name

The name of the player?

### Score

Not used?

### Time Played

Time in minutes?
