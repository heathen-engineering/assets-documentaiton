# Tooltip Window Controller

## Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
part of the [Tooltip System](../learning/core-concepts/tooltips.md) of the UX Complete asset
{% endhint %}

Used to hold a trigger open when the tip window has the pointer over it. This component has no fields and simply acts to keep a trigger open so long as the user's pointer is over the rect of this component.
