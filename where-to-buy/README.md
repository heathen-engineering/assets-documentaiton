Becoming a [sponsor of Heathen on GitHub or Patreon](https://github.com/sponsors/heathen-engineering) is the best way to support us and enable us to deliver more articles, videos, tools, examples, support, and just more! It's also the best way to buy/license all of Heathen's Toolkits, assets and services.

Heathen keeps 100% of the fee (less payment processing) from the Sponsor option. You get access to all of our tools, a site-based license and instant updates. The stores are maintained for those that prefer them but they do take 30% of the fee and require significantly more administration on our part and thus they are simply not as efficient of a place to license Heathen Tools.

{% hint style="success" %}
Sponsoring Heathen at the $15 Monthly (or greater ðŸ¤ª) [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/heathen-engineering) tier is the best way to get all of our great tools.

\
You can cancel your subscription at any time and **KEEP** using the assets you installed. Our [license](heathen-license-agreement.md) **DOES NOT** expire when you cancel your subscription.\
\
Cancelling your subscription only removes your ability to access the Source Repository so if later you want or need updates you can simply sub for another month at your leisure.
